            leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
            at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.   
             
             The Company recognized lease
            liabilities, with corresponding ROU assets, based on the present value of unpaid lease payments for existing operating leases longer
            than twelve months. The ROU assets were adjusted per ASC 842 transition guidance for existing lease-related balances of accrued and prepaid
            rent, unamortized lease incentives provided by lessors, and restructuring liabilities. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single
            lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease
            payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes
            in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur.   
             
             The Company has no finance leases.
            The Company’s leases primarily include various office and laboratory spaces, copy machine, and vehicles under various operating
            lease arrangements. The Company’s operating leases have remaining lease terms of up to approximately five years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) NOTE 1          ORGANIZATION Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") should refer to the Company's (as defined below) audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K (our "Annual Report") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (Commission File No. 001-34948), as certain footnote disclosures which would substantially duplicate those contained in our Annual Report have been omitted from this Quarterly Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation (which include only normal recurring adjustments) have been included in this Quarterly Report. Unless context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used, but not defined in this Quarterly Report, have the same meanings as in our Annual Report.    General Brookfield Property REIT Inc. (referred to herein as "BPYU" or the "Company"), formerly known as GGP Inc. ("GGP"), a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 2010 and is an externally managed real estate investment trust ("REIT").  On March 26, 2018, GGP and Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ("BPY") entered into an agreement and plan of merger (as amended by the amendment thereto dated June 25, 2018, the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which BPY would acquire all of the shares of GGP common stock, par value $ 0.01  per share, that BPY and its affiliates did not already own through a series of transactions (collectively, the "BPY Transaction"), including, among other things, the exchange of all shares of GGP common stock owned by certain affiliates of BPY and any subsidiary of GGP for a newly authorized series of preferred stock of GGP designated Series B Preferred Stock (the "Class B Exchange") and the payment of a special dividend payable to certain holders of record of GGP common stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the "Pre-Closing Dividend"). BPYU is an indirect subsidiary of BPY, one of the world's largest commercial real estate companies. In these notes, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to BPYU and its subsidiaries. BPYU, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is an owner and operator of retail properties. As of September 30, 2020, we were the owner, either entirely or with joint venture partners, of  122  retail properties in the United States. Substantially all of our business is conducted through BPR OP, LP ("BPROP"), which we sometimes refer to herein as the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2020, BPYU held approximately  99 % of the common equity of BPROP, while the remaining  1 % was held by limited partners and certain previous contributors of properties to BPROP. In addition to holding ownership interests in various joint ventures, the Operating Partnership generally conducts its operations through BPR REIT Services LLC ("BPRRS"), Brookfield Properties Retail Inc. ("BPRI") and General Growth Management, Inc. ("GGMI"). Each of GGMI and BPRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which earn real estate management, leasing, development, and financing fees for other ancillary services for a majority of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates (defined below) and for substantially all of our Consolidated Properties (defined below). BPRI also serves as a contractor to GGMI for these services. BPRRS generally provides financial, accounting, tax, legal, development, and other services to our Consolidated Properties. We refer to our ownership interests in properties in which we own a majority or controlling interest and are consolidated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as the "Consolidated Properties." We also own interests in certain properties through joint venture entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest ("Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates") and we refer to those properties as the "Unconsolidated Properties". 12 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) NOTE 2         SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BPYU, our subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest. For consolidated joint ventures, the noncontrolling partner's share of the assets, liabilities and operations of the joint ventures (generally computed as the joint venture partner's ownership percentage) is included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate affiliates as permanent equity of the Company. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Noncontrolling interests are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Common, Preferred, and LTIP Units of BPROP and are presented either as redeemable noncontrolling interests or as noncontrolling interests in our permanent equity. The  Operating Partnership and each of our consolidated joint ventures are variable interest entities as the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. However, as the Company holds a majority voting interest in the Operating Partnership and our consolidated joint ventures, it qualifies for the exemption from providing certain of the disclosure requirements associated with variable interest entities. We operate in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation, development and management of retail and other rental properties. Our portfolio is targeted to a range of market sizes and consumer tastes. Each of our operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of a team of several members of executive management who use property operations in assessing segment operating performance. We do not distinguish or group our consolidated operations based on geography, size or type for purposes of making property operating decisions. Our operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to our tenants. There are no individual operating segments that are greater than  10 % of combined revenue or combined assets. When assessing segment operating performance, certain non-cash and non-comparable items such as straight-line rent, depreciation expense and intangible asset and liability amortization are excluded from property operations, which are a result of GGP's emergence from bankruptcy, acquisition accounting and other capital contribution or restructuring events. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than  10 % of consolidated revenues. As a result, the Company's operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment. Acquisitions of Operating Properties (Note 3) The fair values of tangible assets are determined on an "if vacant" basis. The "if vacant" fair value is allocated to land, where applicable, buildings, equipment and tenant improvements based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property. Specifically, the "if vacant" value of the buildings and equipment was calculated using a cost approach utilizing published guidelines for current replacement cost or actual construction costs for similar, recently developed properties; and an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to the value of buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and site improvement value. The estimated fair value of in-place tenant leases includes lease origination costs (costs we would have incurred to lease the property to the current occupancy level of the property) and the lost revenues during the period necessary to lease-up from vacant to current occupancy level. Such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions, legal costs and tenant coordination costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level. Additionally, we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and include an estimate of the net operating costs (primarily real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities) incurred during the lease-up period, which generally ranges up to one year. The fair value of the acquired in-place tenant leases is included in the balance of buildings and equipment and amortized over the remaining lease term for each tenant. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities are calculated for above-market and below-market tenant and ground leases where we are the lessor or the lessee. The difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases, including significantly below-market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably certain. The remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms significantly below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options and assume the amortization period would coincide with the extended lease term. 13 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) The gross asset balances and accumulated amortization of the in-place value of tenant leases are included in buildings and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Gross Asset Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount As of September 30, 2020       Tenant leases:       In-place value $ 314,921   $ ( 99,142 ) $ 215,779   As of December 31, 2019 Tenant leases: In-place value $ 311,838   $ ( 72,658 ) $ 239,180   The above-market tenant leases are included in prepaid expenses and other assets (Note 14); the below-market tenant leases are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses (Note 15) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Amortization/accretion of all intangibles, including the intangibles in Note 14 and Note 15, had the following effects on our income from continuing operations:    Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,   2020 2019 2020 2019 Amortization/accretion effect on continuing operations $ ( 16,079 ) $ ( 8,665 ) $ ( 61,235 ) $ ( 18,446 ) Future amortization/accretion of all intangibles, including the intangibles in Note 14 and Note 15, is estimated to decrease results from continuing operations as follows: Year Amount 2020 Remaining $ 14,771   2021 42,449   2022 31,641   2023 24,163   2024 19,974   Revenue Recognition and Related Matters Accounting for real estate sales distinguishes between sales to a customer or non-customer for purposes of revenue recognition. Once we, as the seller, determine that we have a contract, we will identify each distinct non-financial asset promised to the counter-party and whether the counter-party obtains control and transfers risks and rewards of ownership of each non-financial asset to determine if we should derecognize the asset. Leases   We have entered into lease arrangements for the land and buildings at certain properties, as well as for the use of office space in Chicago, Illinois. We account for leases under Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02,  Leases  ("ASC 842", "Topic 842", or "the new leasing standard").  The new leasing standard requires lessees to record a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a related lease liability for the rights and obligations associated with all lessee leases. Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842 also modified the lease classification criteria through the elimination of "bright-line" tests, the removal of historical real estate specific lease provisions, and changes to lessor accounting to align with the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 14 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) We elected to use the following additional practical expedients permitted by the new leasing standard: • The short-term lease election that allows a lessee not to apply the balance sheet recognition requirements to leases with a term of 12 months or less; lease payments associated with these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense over the lease term and are not material. • The practical expedient which allows a lessee to not separate lease and non-lease components. We have elected to apply this election to all classes of underlying assets. Lessee arrangements    To account for leases for which we are the lessee under the new leasing standard, contracts must be analyzed upon inception to determine if the arrangement is, or contains, a lease. A lease conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease classification tests and measurement procedures are performed at the lease commencement date. Differences in lease classification will affect only the pattern and classification of expense recognition in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).   The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. The lease liability balance is subsequently amortized using the effective interest method. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using an approach based on the rate of interest that the lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We utilized a market-based approach to estimate the Incremental Borrowing Rate ("IBR") for each individual lease. The approach required significant judgment. Therefore, we utilized different data sets to estimate base IBRs via an analysis of (i) yields on outstanding public debt of BPYU, as well as comparable companies, (ii) observable mortgage rates, and (iii) unlevered property yields and discount rates. We then applied adjustments to account for considerations related to (i) term and (ii) security that may not be fully incorporated by the aforementioned data sets. Based on individual characteristics of each lease, we selected an IBR taking into consideration how each data approach and adjustments thereto incorporate term, currency and security. The lease term is the noncancelable period of the lease, and includes any renewal and termination options we are reasonably certain to exercise. The reasonably certain threshold is evaluated at lease commencement and is typically met if substantial economic incentives or termination penalties are identified.  Lease payments measured at the commencement date include fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, variable lease payments dependent on a rate or index (using the index or rate in effect at lease commencement), any purchase option the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the termination option. Fully variable lease payments without an in-substance fixed component are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which the underlying contingency is resolved. The lease liability is remeasured when the contract is modified, upon the resolution of a contingency such that variable payments become fixed or if our assessment of exercising an extension, termination or purchase option changes. Once remeasured, an adjustment is made to the ROU asset. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized in earnings.  The ROU asset balance is initially measured as the lease liability amount, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to the commencement date, initial direct costs, estimated costs to dismantle, remove, or restore the underlying asset and incentives received.  Our current lessee lease portfolio is comprised primarily of operating leases. If we enter into a finance lease, the new leasing standard requires us to initially recognize and measure these leases using the same method as described above for operating leases. Subsequent to initial recognition, each lease payment would be allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the lease liability. This expense would be recognized over the lease term using the interest method to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period and would be included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The ROU asset would be amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with depreciation recorded in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  15 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) The ROU assets in our operating leases are evaluated for impairment in a manner similar to our operating properties, as described below under "Impairment".  Lessor arrangements    At the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. When the terms of a lease effectively transfer control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a sales-type lease. When a lease does not effectively transfer control of the underlying asset to the lessee, but we obtain a guarantee for the value of the asset from a third party, we classify the lease as a direct financing lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Control of the underlying asset is transferred to the lessee if any of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) lessee has an option to purchase the underlying property that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (iii) the lease term is for the major part of the underlying property’s remaining economic life, (iv) the present value of the sum of lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments is equal to or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property or (v) the underlying property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use at the end of the lease term. As of September 30, 2020, we do not have any material sales-type or direct financing leases.    For operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize rental income on a straight-line basis, including the effect of any free rent periods, over the lease term when collectability of lease payments (and, if applicable, any amounts necessary to satisfy a residual value guarantee) is probable. Variable lease payments are recognized as rental income in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. Variable lease payments include overage rent, which is paid by a tenant when the tenant's sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount, is recognized once tenant sales exceed contractual tenant lease thresholds and is calculated by multiplying the sales in excess of the minimum amount by a percentage defined in the lease. Our leases also contain provisions for tenants to reimburse us for real estate taxes and insurance, as well as for other property operating expenses, marketing costs, and utilities, which are considered to be non-lease components. These tenant reimbursements are most often established in the leases or in less frequent cases computed based upon a formula. W e have elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from the lease component for all classes of underlying assets and determined that the lease component is the predominant component in the contract; therefore, these recoveries are recognized in a manner similar to minimum rents and variable rents within rental revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Recognizing rental and related income on a straight-line basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue recognition from what is contractually due from tenants. Straight-line rents are recorded in accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For leases where collectability of substantially all the lease payments is probable, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of accounts receivable, net, including straight-line rents, which is estimated to be uncollectible. Such estimates are based on our previous recovery experience and expectations of future lease concessions. Lease concessions are generally considered a lease modification and thus are recognized prospectively over the remaining lease term. However, the Company does include its estimate of potential lease concessions when establishing its general reserve, based on its best estimates of total lease concessions expected, recognizing the portion of the total concession that is deemed attributable to the current period through consideration of weighted average remaining lease terms. Changes in the general allowance are recognized in rental income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). If we determine that collectability of substantially all the lease payments is not probable, we record a current-period adjustment to rental income to amount of cash collected from the lessee. This adjustment effectively reduces cumulative income recognized since lease commencement from an accrual basis to cash basis. In addition, future revenue recognition is limited to amounts paid by the lessee. We will generally return to an accrual basis of accounting, if and when, all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the lease agreement and collectability of substantially all the remaining contractual lease payments is reasonably probable.  With respect to our consolidated properties, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we have recorded $ 36.9  million and $ 59.8  million, respectively, associated with potentially uncollectible revenues, which includes $ 2.4  million  16 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) and $ 7.4  million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables. With respect to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates have recorded $ 47.4  million and $ 81.0  million, respectively, associated with potentially uncollectible revenues, which includes $ 3.0  million and $ 10.1  million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables. Of these amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, our share totaled $ 24.9  million and $ 40.1  million, respectively, which includes $ 1.5  million and $ 4.8  million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables. As of September 30, 2020, the Company, including consideration of our share of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates, has collected approximate ly  65 % o f third quarter rents, and collections continue to increase subsequent to quarter end. While working to preserve our profitability and cash flow, we are also working with our tenants regarding requests for lease concessions and other forms of assistance, although we have not executed a significant number of agreements. While we anticipate that we may grant further rent concessions, such as the deferral or abatement of lease payments, such rent concession requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Not all requests for rent relief will be granted as the Company does not intend to forgo its legally enforceable contractual rights that exist under its lease agreements. Rental revenues also includes lease termination income collected from tenants to allow for the tenant to vacate their space prior to their scheduled termination dates, as well as accretion related to above-market and below-market tenant leases on acquired properties and properties that were recorded at fair value at the emergence from bankruptcy. In leasing tenant space, we may provide funding to the lessee through a tenant allowance. To account for a tenant allowance, we determine whether the allowance represents funding for the construction of leasehold improvements  and evaluate the control and ownership of such improvements. If we are considered the owner of the leasehold improvements, we capitalize the amount of the tenant allowance and depreciate it over the shorter of the useful life of the leasehold improveme nts or the related lease term. If the tenant allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event we are not considered the owner of the leasehold improvements, the allowance is capitalized to deferred expenses and considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis. Deferred expenses  The new leasing standard defines initial direct costs as incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. These initial direct costs (consisting primarily of leasing commissions paid to third parties) are recognized as deferred expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the leases. Other leasing costs which do not meet the definition of initial direct costs (consisting primarily of internal legal and leasing overhead costs) are expensed as incurred and included in property management and other costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).   Management Fees and Other Corporate Revenues Management fees and other corporate revenues primarily represent real estate management and leasing fees, development fees, financing fees and fees for other ancillary services performed for the benefit of certain of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. Management fees are reported at  100 % of the revenue earned from the joint venture in management fees and other corporate revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Our share of the management fee expense incurred by the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates is reported within equity in income (loss) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and in property management and other costs in the Condensed Combined Statements of Income in Note 5.   The following table summarizes the management fees from affiliates and our share of the management fee expense:   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,   2020 2019 2020 2019 Management fees from affiliates $ 28,923   $ 44,206   $ 90,826   $ 123,444   Management fee expense ( 9,007 ) ( 11,956 ) ( 25,911 ) ( 36,485 ) Net management fees from affiliates $ 19,916   $ 32,250   $ 64,915   $ 86,959   17 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Management Fee Expense Following the BPY Transaction, certain Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ("BAM")-owned entities provide certain management and administration services to BPYU. BPYU and its affiliates pay a management fee based on market capitalization and metrics defined by management. For the first twelve months following closing of the BPY Transaction, BAM agreed to waive management fees payable by BPYU. Amounts payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $ 4.6  million and $ 12.4  million, respectively. Following the BPY Transaction, an affiliate of BAM is entitled to receive incentive distributions based on an amount by which quarterly distributions exceed specified target levels. There were no such amounts payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Impairment Operating Properties   We regularly review our Consolidated Properties for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators are assessed separately for each property and include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in real estate property net operating income, significant decreases in occupancy, debt maturities, changes in management's intent with respect to the properties and prevailing market conditions.   If an indicator of potential impairment exists, the property is tested for recoverability by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Although the carrying amount may exceed the estimated fair value of certain properties, a real estate asset is only considered to be impaired when its carrying amount cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To the extent an impairment provision is determined to be necessary, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is expensed to operations. In addition, the impairment provision is allocated proportionately to adjust the carrying amount of the asset group. The adjusted carrying amount, which represents the new cost basis of the property, is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the property. Although we may market a property for sale, there can be no assurance that the transaction will be complete until the sale is finalized. However, GAAP requires us to utilize the Company's expected holding period of our properties when assessing recoverability. If we cannot recover the carrying value of these properties within the planned holding period, we will estimate the fair values of the assets and record impairment charges for properties when the estimated fair value is less than their carrying value. Impairment indicators for pre-development costs, which are typically costs incurred during the beginning stages of a potential development and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the Company's plans with respect to the project, significant changes in projected completion dates, tenant demand, anticipated revenues or cash flows, development costs, market factors and sustainability of development projects. Impairment charges are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when the carrying value of a property is not recoverable and it exceeds the estimated fair value of the property, which can occur in accounting periods preceding disposition and/or in the period of disposition.   During the three months ended  September 30, 2020, we recorded no impairment charges.  During the nine months ended  September 30, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of  $ 71.5  million   on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to a reduction in the probability-weighted holding period at  one  of the operating properties, where the Company is currently engaging in negotiations with the creditor to obtain potential lender concessions or other relief (see Note 5). During the three months ended  September 30, 2019 , we recorded an impairment charge of $ 38.8  million on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to one operating property where the carrying value exceeded the transfer price to our affiliate (Note 3). During the nine months ended  September 30, 2019 , we recorded a  18 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) $ 223.1  million impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), $ 184.3  million of which related to one operating property as a result of a significant decrease in market leasing assumptions and $ 38.8  million of which related to the impairment charge on the operating property discussed above. A significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. The Company’s assessment of impairment as of  September 30, 2020  was based on the most current information available to the Company. Based upon current market conditions, certain of the Company’s properties may have fair values less than their carrying amounts. However, based on the Company’s plans with respect to those properties, the Company believes that their carrying amounts are recoverable and therefore, under applicable GAAP guidance, no impairment charges were recognized. If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if the Company’s expected holding period for assets change, subsequent tests for impairment could result in impairment charges in the future. Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value of our investment in an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate has occurred. The investment in each of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates is evaluated for valuation declines below the carrying amount. Accordingly, in addition to the property-specific impairment analysis that we performed for such joint ventures (as part of our operating property impairment process described above), we also considered whether there were other-than-temporary declines with respect to the carrying values of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. Refer to Note 5 for more information. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility.  Our credit risk exposure with regard to our cash and the $ 1.5  billion available under our credit facility is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. We had $ 920.0  million and $ 715.0  million outstanding under our credit facility as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Severance and Other Employee Related Costs  In accordance with ASC 712,  Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits , we recognize severance costs when it becomes probable that a payment will be made and the amount is estimable.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded $ 12.0  million of severance costs included in accounts payable on our Consolidated Balances Sheets and property management costs on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), related to a workforce reduction. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Due to the business disruptions and challenges severely affecting the global economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19" or "the global economic shutdown" or "the shutdown"), lessors may provide rent deferrals and other lease concessions to lessees. In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") staff issued a question and answer document (the "Lease Modification Q&A") focused on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the global economic shutdown. Under existing lease guidance, economic relief that is agreed to or negotiated outside of the original lease agreement is typically considered a lease modification, in which case both the lessee and lessor would be required to apply the respective modification frameworks. However, if the lessee was entitled to the economic relief because of either contractual or legal rights, the relief would be accounted for outside of the modification framework. Although the original lease modification guidance in ASC 842,  Leases  remain appropriate to address routine lease modifications, the Lease Modification Q&A established a different framework to account for certain lease concessions granted in response to the global economic shutdown. The Lease Modification Q&A allows the Company, if certain criteria have been met, to make an accounting policy election to account for COVID-19 related lease concessions as either a lease modification or a negative variable adjustment to rental revenue. Such election is required to be applied consistently to leases with similar characteristics and similar circumstances.  19 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) The Company has elected to apply such relief and will avail itself of the election to treat leases as lease modifications, thereby avoiding performing a lease by lease analysis for the lease concessions that were (1) granted as relief due to the shutdown and (2) result in the cash flows remaining substantially the same or less than the original contract. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments) , which changes the model for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. Specifically, the amendments in the ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19,  Codification   Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of this new guidance. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 which did not materially impact its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13,  Fair Value Measurement . Public entities will be required to disclose the following: (i) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and (ii) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. In addition, public entities will no longer be required to disclose the following: (i) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (ii) the policy for timing of transfers between levels and (iii) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The new pronouncement also clarifies and modifies certain existing provisions, including eliminating "at a minimum" from the phrase "an entity shall disclose at a minimum" to promote the appropriate exercise of discretion by entities when considering fair value measurement disclosures and clarifying that materiality is an appropriate consideration when evaluating disclosure requirements. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 which did not materially impact its consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,  Reference Rate Reform . This temporary guidance is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 to ease potential burdens related to the accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients for applying existing GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships affected by the move of global capital markets away from interbank offered rates, most notably the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company has not adopted any of the optional expedients or exceptions as of  September 30, 2020 , but will continue to evaluate the possible adoption of any such expedients or exceptions during the effective period as circumstances evolve. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. For example, estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to allocating the purchase price of real estate acquisitions, the useful lives of assets, capitalization of development and leasing costs, provision for income taxes, recoverable amounts of receivables and deferred taxes, provision for loan loss, initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with respect to acquisitions, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation related accruals and disclosures and fair value of debt. Actual results could differ from these and other estimates. NOTE 3         ACQUISITIONS, SALES AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY On September 3, 2020, the Company transferred its right in the Sears Anchor Parcel at The Mall in Columbia to TMIC FS Anchor Parcel LLC, a subsidiary of Mall in Columbia JV LLC.

Chang's") (par value $ 0.01  per share) at a price of $ 1.00  per share, for a $ 10.0  million total investment, resulting in a  3.2 % ownership interest in P.F. Chang's. P.F. Chang's is a tenant at certain properties for which we receive rental income included in rental revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The investment is accounted for using the cost method as the Company has neither control nor significant influence over P.F. Chang's and is included in Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On August 26, 2019, the Company purchased an additional ownership interest of  49.677 % in 730 Fifth Owners, LLC from its joint venture partner resulting in the Company obtaining control of the entity with a total ownership percentage for the Company of  99.677 %. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The transaction consideration consisted of cash consideration of $ 153.0  million and satisfaction of notes receivable of $ 249.5  million from the joint venture partner. Because of the presence of non-cash consideration, the Company determined that the fair value of the net assets acquired was more readily determinable than the fair value of the consideration given, and determined that the aggregate fair value of the joint venture's equity was $ 808.0  million on the acquisition date, which was allocated to the Company's  99.677 % ownership interest for $ 805.4  million and the joint venture partner's remaining  0.323 % non-controlling interest for $ 2.6  million. Concurrent with this transaction, the joint venture partner repaid $ 54.7  million of interest on the notes receivable (including amounts that had been annually capitalized onto the outstanding principal balance). The Company recorded a gain on change in  21 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) control of investment properties of $ 39.7  million related to the Company's previously held  50 % ownership interest. Immediately following this transaction, the Company sold a condominium interest in one unit of the property to an affiliate of the joint venture partner for a gross sales price of $ 12.6  million to an affiliate of the joint venture partner, and incurred fees of $ 0.4  million, which resulted in no gain or loss, as the fair value of the condominium interest in the consolidation transaction had been determined to be $ 12.2  million.  The table below summarizes the gain from changes in control of investment properties ($ in millions): Fair value of Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates as of change in control $ 404.0   Less: carrying value of Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates 364.3 Gain from changes in control of investment properties and other, net $ 39.7   The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. The allocation were based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed ($ in millions): Investment in real estate, including intangible assets and liabilities $ 1,560.5   Debt held by the joint venture ( 720.0 ) Net working capital ( 32.5 ) Net assets acquired $ 808.0   On August 19, 2019, the Company sold the SoNo Collection to a newly formed joint venture owned  80.5 % by an affiliated fund (which is a related party of the Company) and  19.5 % by the Company. The property was contributed to the joint venture at a value of $419.3 million based on project-specific cash costs. This excludes additional costs to complete the project by the joint venture. Prior to obtaining project-specific financing on August 9, 2019, the Company was required under GAAP to capitalize interest on general corporate financings into the cost basis of the project, which resulted in a $ 38.8  million impairment due to the difference between the project’s GAAP basis and the sale price based upon total project-specific cash costs. Following the transaction, the Company accounts for its non-controlling investment in the SoNo Collection under the equity method of accounting as the Company can exercise significant influence but not control over the joint venture. On August 12, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the land in the former Sears Anchor Parcel at Columbia Mall for a gross sales price of $ 5.0  million, which resulted in a gain on the sale of $ 3.6  million included in other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. On August 9, 2019, the Company completed the sale of  49.3 % of its interest in Authentic Brands Group LLC ("ABG") for a gross sales price of $ 32.1  million, which resulted in a gain on the sale of $ 16.8  million included in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - Gain on Investment on the Consolidated Statements Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The basis of the remaining  50.7 % investment was marked to fair value of $ 32.1  million in conjunction with the sale transaction noted above, which resulted in an additional gain on sale of $ 16.8  million directly related to the step up basis in fair value. This gain is recorded in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - Gain on Investment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain of $ 104.4  million included in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - (loss) gain on investment, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. NOTE 4          FAIR VALUE   Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements We estimate fair value relating to impairment assessments based upon discounted cash flow and direct capitalization models that include all projected cash inflows and outflows over a specific holding period, or the negotiated sales price, if applicable. Such projected cash flows are comprised of contractual rental revenues and forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon market conditions and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based on a reasonable range of current market rates for each property analyzed. Based upon these inputs, we determined that our valuations of properties using a discounted cash flow or a direct capitalization model were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For our properties for which the estimated fair value was based on negotiated sales prices, we determined that our valuation was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes certain of our assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges recorded. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized no impairment charges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $ 71.5  million in impairment charges. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized $ 38.8  million and $ 223.1  million in impairment charges, respectively.

(2)    Includes net market rate adjustments of $ 4.7  million and deferred financing costs of $ 131.8  million, net . The fair value of our junior subordinated notes approximates their carrying amount as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. We estimated the fair value of mortgages, notes and other loans payable using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs based on recent financing transactions, estimates of the fair value of the property that serves as collateral for such debt, historical risk premiums for loans of comparable quality, current  LIBOR , U.S. treasury obligation interest rates and on the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt. The discount rates estimated reflect our judgment as to what the approximate current lending rates for loans or groups of loans with similar maturities and assume that the debt is outstanding through maturity. We have utilized market information as available or present value techniques to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions and do not acknowledge transfer or other repayment restrictions that may exist in specific loans, it is unlikely that the estimated fair value of any such debt could be realized by immediate settlement of the obligation. 24 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

The Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates represent our investments in real estate joint ventures that are not consolidated. We hold interests in  25  domestic joint ventures, comprising  59  U.S. retail properties and  one  joint venture in Brazil. Generally, we share in the profits and losses, cash flows and other matters relating to our investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in accordance with our respective ownership percentages. We manage most of the properties owned by these joint ventures. We account for investments in joint ventures where we own a non-controlling joint interest using either the equity method or the cost method (adjusted for impairment and observable price changes). If we have significant influence but not control over the investment, we utilize the equity method. If we have neither control nor significant influence, we utilize the cost method. If we control the joint venture, we account for the venture as a consolidated investment. 26 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) As of September 30, 2020, the balance of ROU assets was $ 68.1  million, net and lease liabilities of $ 70.1  million for  24  ground leases in the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets - Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates under Topic 842, included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of ROU assets was $ 68.9  million, net and lease liabilities was $ 71.0  million for  24  ground leases in the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets - Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates under Topic 842, included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities, respectively. All of these leases are operating leases; we do not have any finance leases. On May 27, 2020, the Company acquired an additional ownership interest of  49.5 % in the Water Tower Joint Venture from its joint venture partner for nominal consideration. Following this, the Company has a  93.93 % ownership interest in the joint venture and its wholly owned subsidiary. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded $ 4.9  million and $ 88.9  million, respectively, of impairment charges on our Condensed Combined Statements of Income (Loss) - Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates related to three operating properties. Unconsolidated Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, and Retained Debt Our proportionate share of the mortgages, notes and loans payable of the unconsolidated joint ventures was $ 7.0  billion as of September 30, 2020 and $ 7.2  billion as of December 31, 2019, including Retained Debt (as defined below). There can be no assurance that the Unconsolidated Properties will be able to refinance or restructure such debt on acceptable terms or otherwise, or that joint venture operations or contributions by us and/or our partners will be sufficient to repay such loans. On February 28, 2020, the Company closed a new loan at the Miami Design District joint venture in the amount of $ 500.0  million with an interest rate of  4.13 %, which matures on March 1, 2030. The loan replaced the previous debt of $ 480.0  million with an interest rate of LIBOR plus  2.50 % that was scheduled to mature on May 14, 2021. As a result of the refinancing, the joint venture incurred $ 3.7  million of deferred financing costs that were capitalized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on eight property level mortgages. The Company is currently engaging in negotiations with the creditors on these mortgages to obtain potential lender concessions or other relief. If the Company is unsuccessful in obtaining concessions from these creditors, it is possible that the property securing these loans would be transferred to the lenders. In such circumstances, the carrying value of the property may no longer be recoverable and may trigger an impairment charge. These mortgages are non-recourse and the creditors do not have security claims against the Company aside from the collateral property. In total at share, as of September 30, 2020, the Company has suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on a total of $ 560.9  million of property level mortgages and the related Investment in Real Estate securing these loans has a carrying value of $ 548.1  million. We have debt obligations in excess of our pro rata share of the debt for  one  of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates ("Retained Debt"). This Retained Debt represents distributed debt proceeds of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in excess of our pro rata share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness. The proceeds of the Retained Debt which were distributed to us are included as a reduction in our investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. We had Retained Debt of $ 80.2  million at  one  property as of September 30, 2020, and $ 81.5  million as of December 31, 2019. We are obligated to contribute funds on an ongoing basis, as needed, to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in amounts sufficient to pay debt service on such Retained Debt. If we do not contribute such funds, our interest in or our distributions from such Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates could be reduced to the extent of such deficiencies. As of September 30, 2020, we do not anticipate an inability to perform on our obligations with respect to Retained Debt. 27 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

Certain of these consolidated secured loans, representing $ 1.3  billion of debt, are cross-collateralized. Although a majority of the $ 10.5  billion of fixed and variable rate collateralized mortgages, notes and loans payable are non-recourse, $ 726.6  million of such mortgages, notes and loans payable are recourse to the Company as guarantees on secured financings. In addition, certain mortgage loans contain other credit enhancement provisions which have been provided by BPYU. Certain mortgages, notes and loans payable may be prepaid but are generally subject to a prepayment penalty equal to a yield-maintenance premium, defeasance or a percentage of the loan balance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on ten consolidated property level mortgages, including one mortgage that is in maturity default. The Company is currently engaging in negotiations with the creditors on these mortgages to obtain potential lender concessions or other relief.

In such circumstances, the carrying value of the property may no longer be recoverable and may trigger an impairment charge. These mortgages are non-recourse and the creditors do not have security claims against the Company aside from the collateral property. In total, as of September 30, 2020, the Company has suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on a total of $ 1.3  billion of consolidated property level mortgages and the related Investment in Real Estate securing these loans has a carrying value of $ 1.4  billion.

The match-funding requirement will be required to be made (i) monthly, whereby any drawing during that month is in excess of the prior highest balance of the revolver (in excess of $ 1.0  billion), (ii) within 10 business days of a request from the agent if as of any day during a month, the excess draw amount would exceed $ 10  million and (iii) at any time of request for a revolving loan that the excess would be $ 100  million or greater (which would be match-funded substantially concurrently with the requested revolving loan draw). • The Company will also be required to make additional prepayments of the Term A loans with proceeds of certain equity, debt issuances and asset sales. • The Company also agreed to a number of additional restrictions, including restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and the use of proceeds under the revolving facility, which will apply either through the end of the Covenant Relief Period – and in the case of certain provisions, until the Company demonstrates compliance with the financial covenants in effect under the Credit Agreement prior to the First Amendment. As of September 30, 2020, we are not aware of any instances of non-compliance with such covenants. Though there is potential for a risk of default (See Note 17 for discussion specific to COVID-19), in the event the Company fails to maintain compliance with its financial covenants, the Credit Agreement provides for a cure period, during which the Company has the opportunity to raise additional cash and reduce net debt balance, such as through capital contributions from BPY, or disposition of assets. Management has determined that in the event of a default, it is probable that these market-based alternatives would be available, and that these actions would provide the necessary cash flows to prevent or cure an event of default, although there is no guarantee that these market-based alternatives would be available. 31 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Junior Subordinated Notes GGP Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), completed a private placement of $ 200.0  million of trust preferred securities ("TRUPS") in 2006. The Trust also issued $ 6.2  million of common securities to BPROP. The Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the TRUPS and common securities to purchase $ 206.2  million of floating rate junior subordinated notes of BPROP due 2036. Distributions on the TRUPS are equal to  LIBOR  plus  1.45 %. Distributions are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. The TRUPS mature on April 30, 2036, but may be redeemed beginning on April 30, 2011 if the Trust exercises its right to redeem a like amount of junior subordinated notes. The junior subordinated notes bear interest at LIBOR plus  1.45 % and are fully recourse to the Company. We have recorded the junior subordinated notes as a liability and our common equity interest in the Trust as prepaid expenses and other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 49.9  million as of September 30, 2020 and $ 50.0  million as of December 31, 2019. These letters of credit and bonds were issued primarily in connection with insurance requirements, special real estate assessments and construction obligations. We are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance with our financial covenants related to our mortgages, notes and loans payable as of September 30, 2020. NOTE 7          LEASES Lessee arrangements   We are the lessee in several ground lease agreements for the land under some of our owned buildings. Generally, we own the land underlying the properties; however, at certain properties, all or part of the underlying land is owned by a third party that leases the land to us through a long-term ground lease. In addition, we lease office space for our corporate headquarters and field offices. Our material consolidated leases have reasonably certain lease terms ranging from  four years  to  forty years . Certain leases provide the lessee with  two  to  three   renewal options which are considered to be termination options unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will elect to renew and generally range from  five years  to  ten years  each, with renewal rent payments based on a predetermined annual increase, market rates at the time of exercise of the renewal, or changes in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI").  As of September 30, 2020, the balance of ROU assets was $ 395.0  million, net and lease liabilities of $ 75.8  million for  seven  ground leases and  one  office lease in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under Topic 842, included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively.  The maturity of our   operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2020 is as follows: Year Amount Remainder of 2020 $ 2,316   2021 9,470   2022 9,704   2023 9,968   2024 10,200   2025 10,439   2026 and thereafter 155,012   Total undiscounted lease payments 207,109   Less: Present value adjustment ( 131,281 ) Total lease liability $ 75,828   32 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

Several lease agreements include variable lease payments which vary based on factors such as sublease income received, the revenues or net operating income of the properties constructed on the leased premises, increases in CPI, and changes in market rents. In addition, our leases require us to reimburse the lessor for the lessor’s tax, insurance and common area costs. Variable lease payments and short-term lease costs recognized as rent expense for operating leases were not significant for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 and are included in other property operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

As of September 30, 2020, we own a controlling interest in and consolidated  63  retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately  55  million square feet of GLA. We enter into operating leases with a variety of tenants, the majority of which are national and regional retail chains and local retailers. These operating leases expire starting in the remainder of year 2020 and typically include renewal options, which are generally exercisable only by the tenant. Certain leases also include early termination options which are typically exercisable only by the tenant. Our leases do not allow the tenant to purchase the retail space. The maturity analysis of the lease payments we expect to receive from our operating leases as of September 30, 2020 is as follows: Year Amount Remainder of 2020 $ 276,694   2021 1,047,375   2022 947,590   2023 828,518   2024 693,861   2025 566,118   Subsequent 1,820,055   $ 6,180,211   33 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

Effective January 1, 2019, with the adoption of Topic 842, rental revenues is presented net of provision for doubtful accounts. Rental income recognized on a straight-line basis consists primarily of fixed and in-substance fixed lease payments (including lease payments related to non-lease components which have been combined with the lease component). Variable rental income represents variable lease payments, which consist primarily of overage rents; reimbursements for tenants’ pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, property operating and marketing expenses, and utilities; lease payments related to CPI-based escalations and market rent resets; and lease termination income.  In accordance with the terms of our operating leases, we bill our tenants separately for minimum rents, tenant recoveries, overage rents and lease termination income as shown below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Minimum rents, billed $ 249,167   $ 224,326   $ 752,053   $ 665,263   Tenant recoveries, billed 101,133   89,253   298,029   269,346   Lease termination income, billed 2,637   3,875   5,004   6,320   Overage rent, billed 1,567   2,865   7,060   9,159   Total contractual operating lease billings 354,504   320,319   1,062,146   950,088   Adjustment to recognize contractual operating lease billings on a straight-line basis 1,757   1,684   5,943   5,633   Above and below-market tenant leases, net 7,193   ( 37 ) 7,995   7,250   Less provision for doubtful accounts ( 36,747 ) ( 4,497 ) ( 56,475 ) ( 8,243 ) Total rental revenues, net $ 326,707   $ 317,469   $ 1,019,609   $ 954,728   Of the  total contractual rental revenues we have billed,  82.4 % and  81.5 % are fixed lease payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and  78.0 % and  78.9 % are fixed lease payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. NOTE 8          INCOME TAXES The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We intend to maintain REIT status. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least  90 % of our taxable ordinary income. In addition, the Company is required to meet certain asset and income tests. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to corporate level Federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to Federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income or property, and to Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income and capital gains. Depending on the extended due date for partnership and corporate income tax returns, we are statutorily open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2017 through 2019 and are generally statutorily open to audit by state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2016 through 2019. We have  no  unrecognized tax benefits recorded pursuant to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2020. 34 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

The following table reflects the activity included in the allocation to noncontrolling interests.

Noncontrolling Interests The noncontrolling interest related to the Common, Preferred, and LTIP Units of BPROP are presented either as redeemable noncontrolling interests in mezzanine equity or as noncontrolling interests in our permanent equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Classification as redeemable or permanent equity is considered on a tranche-by-tranche basis and is dependent on whether we could be required, under certain events outside of our control, to redeem the securities for cash by the holders of the securities. Those tranches for which we could be required to redeem the security for cash are included in redeemable equity. If we control the decision to redeem the securities for cash, the securities are classified as permanent equity. The redeemable Common and Preferred Units of BPROP are recorded at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest’s share of the allocation of income or loss (and its share of other comprehensive income or loss) and dividends or their redemption value (i.e. fair value) as of each measurement date. The excess of the fair value over the carrying amount from period to period is recorded within additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Allocation to noncontrolling interests is presented as an adjustment to net income (loss) to arrive at net income (loss) attributable to BPYU. The preferred redeemable noncontrolling interests have been recorded at carrying value. Holders of Series B Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units, Series E Preferred Units and Series G Preferred Units of BPROP are each entitled to periodic distributions at the rates set forth in the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of BPROP. Generally, each Series K Preferred Unit of BPROP entitles its holder to distributions and a liquidation preference identical to those established for each share of BPYU's Class A Stock. The holders of Series L Preferred Units of BPROP are generally entitled to a pro rata distribution of an aggregate cash amount equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate cash dividends declared on all outstanding shares of BPYU's Class B Stock and (ii) the aggregate cash dividends declared on all outstanding shares of BPYU's Series B Preferred Stock. Holders of Common Units of BPROP are entitled to distributions of all or a portion of BPROP’s remaining net operating cash flow, when and as declared by BPROP’s general partner. However, the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of BPROP permits distributions solely to BPYU if such distributions were required to allow the Company to comply with the REIT distribution requirements or to avoid the imposition of excise tax. 35 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Noncontrolling Interests - Permanent As of September 30, 2020, there were  9,717.658  Series B Preferred Units of BPROP outstanding.

Noncontrolling Interests - Redeemable The Series D Preferred Units of BPROP are convertible based on a conversion ratio of  1.50821 , which is the quotient of the Series D Preferred Unit’s $ 50  liquidation preference and $ 33.151875  conversion price. Upon conversion, each Series D Preferred Unit entitles its holder to (i) $ 21.9097  in cash, (ii) a number of Series K Preferred Units of BPROP equal to (x)  0.40682134  Series K Preferred Units (which is subject to adjustment), multiplied by (y) the Series D conversion ratio; and (iii) a number of Common Units of BPROP equal to (x) one Common Unit (which is subject to adjustment), multiplied by (y) the Series D conversion ratio. As of September 30, 2020, there were  532,749.6574  Series D Preferred Units of BPROP outstanding.  The Series E Preferred Units of BPROP are convertible based on a conversion ratio of  1.29836 , which is the quotient of the Series E Preferred Unit’s $ 50  liquidation preference and $ 38.51  conversion price. Upon conversion, each Series E Preferred Unit entitles its holder to (i) $ 18.8613  in cash, (ii) a number of Series K Preferred Units of BPROP equal to (x)  0.40682134  Series K Preferred Units (which is subject to adjustment), multiplied by (y) the Series E conversion ratio; and (iii) a number of Common Units of BPROP equal to (x) one Common Unit (which is subject to adjustment), multiplied by (y) the Series E conversion ratio. As of September 30, 2020, there were  502,657.8128  Series E Preferred Units of BPROP outstanding. The holder of each Series K Preferred Unit of BPROP issued upon conversion of Series D Preferred Units or Series E Preferred Units of BPROP has the right to redeem such Series K Preferred Unit for a cash amount equal to the average closing price of BPYU’s Class A Stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the date of the notice of redemption, provided that BPYU may elect to satisfy such redemption by delivering one share of BPYU’s Class A Stock. The holder of each Common Unit of BPROP issued upon conversion of Series D Preferred Units or Series E Preferred Units of BPROP has the right to redeem such Common Unit for a cash amount equal to $ 0.324405869 , subject to adjustment. Each LTIP Unit of BPROP is convertible into, and, except for the level of preference, entitles its holder to regular and liquidating distributions equivalent to that of  0.016256057  Series K Preferred Units, subject to adjustment. Each Series K Preferred Unit received by an LTIP holder in connection with the BPY Transaction is redeemable for a cash amount equal to the average closing price of BPYU's Class A Stock for five consecutive trading days ending on the date of the notice of redemption, provided that BPYU may elect to satisfy such redemption by delivering one share of BPYU's Class A Stock. If the holders had requested redemption of the Class A Stock and Preferred Units as of September 30, 2020, the aggregate amount of cash the Company would have paid would have been $ 510.9  million and $ 55.5  million, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

The Company's Class A Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). Our Class A Stock has traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "BPYU" since March 2, 2020, prior to which it traded under the symbol "BPR". Each share of Class A Stock is entitled to cumulative dividends per share in a cash amount equal in value to the amount of any distribution made on a BPY limited partnership unit ("BPY unit"). In addition, each share of Class A Stock is exchangeable for one BPY unit or its cash equivalent (the form of payment to be determined by BPY or an affiliate, in its sole discretion). Such exchange and distribution rights are subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive or other capital events by BPY or BPYU. If and to the extent declared by the Company's board of directors, the record and payment dates for the dividends or other distributions upon the shares of Class A Stock, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, is expected to be the same as the record and payment dates for the dividends or other distributions upon the BPY units. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's charter, all such dividends to holders of Class A Stock will be paid prior and in preference to any dividends or distributions on the Class B Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Class C Stock will be fully declared and paid before any dividends are declared and paid or any other distributions are made on any Class B Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Class C Stock. The holders of Class A Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends from BPYU other than the Class A dividend. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company that is not a Market Capitalization Liquidation Event (as defined below) or substantially concurrent with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of BPY, the holders of Class A Stock are entitled to a cash amount, for each share of Class A Stock, equal to the market price of one BPY unit (subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive or other capital events by BPY or BPYU) on the date immediately preceding announcement of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus all declared and unpaid dividends. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the assets of BPYU are insufficient to make such payment in full, then the assets of BPYU will be distributed among the holders of Class A Stock ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled to receive. 37 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) If the market capitalization of the Class A Stock (i.e., if the price per share of Class A Stock, multiplied by the number of shares of Class A Stock outstanding) averages, over any period of 30 consecutive trading days, less than one (1) billion dollars, the BPYU board will have the right to liquidate BPYU’s assets and wind up BPYU’s operations (a "Market Capitalization Liquidation Event"). Upon any Market Capitalization Liquidation Event, the holders of Class A Stock shall be entitled to a cash amount, for each share of Class A Stock, equal to the dollar volume-weighted average price of one BPY unit over the ten (10) trading days immediately following the public announcement of such Market Capitalization Liquidation Event, plus all declared and unpaid dividends. If, upon any such Market Capitalization Liquidation Event, the assets of BPYU are insufficient to make such payment in full, then the assets of BPYU will be distributed among the holders of Class A Stock ratably in proportion to the full amounts which they would otherwise be respectively entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any Market Capitalization Liquidation Event, BPY may elect to exchange all of the outstanding shares of the Class A Stock for BPY units on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive or other capital events by BPY or BPYU.  Holders of Class A Stock shall have the right to exchange all or a portion of their Class A Stock for cash at a price equal to the value of an equivalent number of BPY units, subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive or other capital events by BPY or BPYU. Upon receipt of a request for exchange, BPYU will deliver a notice of exchange to BPY within one (1) business day and will have ten (10) business days to deliver the cash amount to the tendering holder. Upon receipt of the notice of exchange, BPY or an affiliate may elect to satisfy BPYU’s exchange obligation by exchanging all of the shares of the Class A Stock tendered for BPY units on a one-for-one basis. This initial one-for-one conversion factor is subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive or other capital events by BPY or BPYU. If so elected, BPY will have to satisfy such obligation within ten (10) business days from the date of the notice of exchange. If BPY exercises its right to assume the exchange obligation, units of BPY units will be delivered in exchange for the Class A Stock and such Class A Stock will automatically be converted into Class B Stock. As there are certain events outside of the Company’s control whereby it could be required to redeem the Class A Stock for cash by the holders of the securities, the Class A Stock is included in redeemable equity. Accordingly, the Class A Stock are recorded at the greater of the carrying amount or their redemption value (i.e. fair value) as of each measurement date. The excess of the fair value over the carrying amount from period to period is recorded within additional paid-in capital in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. There is no adjustment within additional paid-in capital for the Class A stock when the fair value is less than the carrying value. Class B Stock The Company’s shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Company’s charter at its annual stockholder meeting on June 19, 2019 (the "Restated Charter"), which became effective on June 26, 2019 and, among other things, authorized the Company’s issuance of up to  965,000,000  shares of a new class of stock called Class B-2 Stock, par value of $0.01 per share. Each share of Class B-2 Stock shall have terms (including the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions) identical to the terms of a share of Class B-1 Stock other than voting rights. The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the Company's Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock (together the "Class B Stock"). Pursuant to the Restated Charter and subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes, including the Class A Stock, and any series of preferred stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, each share of Class B Stock entitles its holder to cumulative dividends per share in a cash amount at a rate of  6.5 % per year of the Class B liquidation amount per share (which rate was  10.0 % per year until the effective date of the Restated Charter on June 26, 2019) equal to $ 21.39  per share. On October 18, 2018, each holder of the Class B-1 Stock hereby irrevocably waived, all of its right, title and interest in and to  2.5 % of the dividend rate, including without elimination all rights and entitlement to payment of such amounts. This partial dividend waiver resulted in a  7.5 % effective rate per year of the Class B Liquidation Amount per share and was terminated upon the effectiveness of the Restated Charter. Dividends on the Class B Stock may also be paid by an in-kind distribution of additional shares of Class B Stock or any other class of shares of capital stock of BPYU ranking junior to the Class A Stock. Dividends on the Class B Stock shall be cumulative and shall be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors with respect to dividends on the Class B Stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) defined below) is equal to or greater than 1.25:1, (ii) if any tendering holder of Class A Stock has not received the cash or BPY units due upon exchange or (iii) if holders of Class A Stock are owed cash in the event of an adjustment to the conversion factor.

Series B Preferred Stock The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series B Preferred Stock").

Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock may also be paid by an in-kind distribution of additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock or any other class of shares of capital stock of BPYU ranking junior to the Class A Stock and Class B Stock. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall be cumulative and shall be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors with respect to dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock.

The dividend coverage ratio is referred to as a ratio of (i) BPYU’s funds from operations, as calculated in accordance with the definition of funds from operations used by Nareit, for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, to (ii) the product of (a) the amount of the most recent regular quarterly distribution declared by BPY on each BPY unit, times (b) the number of shares of Class A Stock outstanding at such time. Class C Stock Class C Stock refers to the Company's Class C Stock, par value $ 0.01  per share, authorized as part of the BPY Transaction. Pursuant to the amended charter and subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes, including the holders of Class A Stock, Class B Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and any series of preferred stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, each share of Class C Stock will entitle its holder to dividends when, as and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors out of any assets of BPYU legally available therefore.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Class B-1 Stock Issuance & Repurchase In the first quarter of 2019, BPYU repurchased  10,496,703  shares of Class B-1 Stock held by BPR FIN 1 Subco LLC, a related party, for fair market value consideration of $ 224.5  million, being the redemption amount of the shares acquired at $ 21.39  per share. In the fourth quarter of 2019, BPYU issued  13,712,834  shares of Class B-1 Stock to BPR FIN 1 Subco LLC, a related party, due to a contribution of $ 293.3  million, equal to $ 21.39  per share. In the third quarter 2020, BPYU issued  19,367,288  shares of Class B-1 Stock to BPR FIN I Subco LLC, a related party, due to total contributions of $ 414.3  million, equal to $ 21.39  per share. Class B-2 Stock Exchange On June 26, 2019, following the effectiveness of the Restated Charter, certain subsidiaries of BPR FIN 1 Subco LLC, a related party, exchanged an aggregate of  121,203,654  shares of Class B-1 Stock held by such subsidiaries for  121,203,654  shares of Class B-2 Stock. Preferred Stock On February 13, 2013, we issued, in a public offering,  10,000,000  shares of  6.375 % Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Pre-Merger Preferred Stock") at a price of $ 25.00  per share, resulting in net proceeds of $ 242.0  million after issuance costs. In connection with the BPY Transaction, each share of Pre-Merger Preferred Stock was converted into one share of  6.375 % Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock of BPYU (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The Company's Series A Preferred Stock is listed on Nasdaq. Our Series A Preferred Stock has traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "BPYUP" since March 2, 2020, prior to which it traded under the symbol "BPRAP". The Series A Preferred Stock is recorded net of issuance costs within equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accrues a quarterly dividend at an annual rate of  6.375 %. The dividend is paid in arrears in preference to dividends on our Class A Stock, and reduces net income available to stockholders, and therefore, earnings per share. The Series A Preferred Stock does not have a stated maturity date but we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for $ 25.00  per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon certain circumstances surrounding a change of control, holders of Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert each share of their Series A Preferred Stock into a number of shares of Class A Stock or Class C Stock, at the option of the holder, equivalent to $ 25.00  plus accrued and unpaid dividends, but not to exceed a cap of  2.4679  shares of Class A Stock or Class C Stock (subject to certain adjustments related to splits, subdivisions, or combinations). The BPY Transaction did not meet the definition of a change in control per the certificate of designation governing the Series A Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors declared preferred stock dividends during 2020 and 2019 as follows: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share 2020 November 5 December 15, 2020 January 1, 2021 $ 0.3984  August 5 September 15, 2020 October 1, 2020 0.3984   May 7 June 15, 2020 July 1, 2020 0.3984   February 5 March 15, 2020 April 1, 2020 0.3984   2019 November 4 December 13, 2019 January 1, 2020 $ 0.3984   August 1 September 13, 2019 October 1, 2019 0.3984   May 6 June 14, 2019 July 1, 2019 0.3984   February 6 March 15, 2019 April 1, 2019 0.3984   42 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

Additionally, for purposes of allocating earnings to Class A Stock, the portion of the change in the carrying amount of Class A Stock that reflects a redemption in excess of fair value is considered a dividend to the Class A stockholders. As the Class A Stock redemption value approximates its fair value, basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for Class A Stock is equivalent to the dividends declared for the period January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. There were  64,024,422  and  41,743,422  shares of Class A Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, respectively. EPS is not presented for Class B Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Class C Stock as these classes of stock are not publicly traded. NOTE 11      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The GGP Inc. 2010 Equity Plan (the "Equity Plan"), renamed as the Amended and Restated Brookfield Property REIT Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan on August 28, 2018 in connection with the BPY Transaction, reserves for the issuance of  4 % of outstanding Class A Stock on a fully diluted basis. The Equity Plan provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and performance-based compensation (collectively, the "Awards"). The Company's directors, officers and other employees and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible for the Awards. The Equity Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. No participant may be granted more than  4,000,000  shares, or the equivalent dollar value of such shares, in any year. Options granted under the Equity Plan will be designated as either nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options. An option granted as an incentive stock option will, to the extent it fails to qualify as an incentive stock option, be treated as a nonqualified option. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair value of a share of BPYU's Class A Stock on the date of grant. The term of each option will be determined prior to the date of grant, but may not exceed  10  years. In addition to the Equity Plan, effective February 20, 2019, the Brookfield Property Group Restricted BPR Class A Stock Plan and Brookfield Property L.P. FV LTIP Unit Plan (the "2019 Plans") provide for grants of Restricted Class A Shares of BPR, now BPYU, stock and FV LTIP Units of Brookfield Property L.P. respectively. Officers and employees of any member of the Brookfield Properties Group and of their respective affiliates are eligible for Awards under these plans. In connection with the BPY Transaction, the Equity Plan was amended and certain outstanding awards were modified. All outstanding GGP in and out of the money options were canceled and replaced with Class A Stock of BPYU and BPY options, respectively. Certain existing appreciation only LTIP awards were canceled and replaced with substitute awards of a BPY affiliate. Outstanding restricted GGP shares were replaced with restricted shares of Class A Stock. As the awards were modified in conjunction with an equity restructuring, they were accounted for as modifications. Incremental compensation cost was measured as the excess of the fair value of the replacement awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before the terms were modified. Total compensation cost measured at the date of modification was the grant-date fair value of the original awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered (or has already been rendered) plus the incremental cost associated with the replacement awards. For vested awards, incremental compensation cost was recognized on the modification date. For unvested awards, incremental compensation cost is being recognized over the remaining service period. 43 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc.

In management's opinion, the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company is subject to litigation related to the BPY Transaction. The Company cannot predict the outcome of pending litigation, nor can it predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve such litigation. 47 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) NOTE 17      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We lease land or buildings at certain properties from third parties. The leases generally provide us with a right of first refusal in the event of a proposed sale of the property by the landlord. Rental payments are expensed as incurred and have, to the extent applicable, been straight-lined over the term of the lease.  The following is a summary of our contractual rental expense as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss):   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,   2020 2019 2020 2019   (Dollars in thousands) Contractual rent expense, including participation rent $ 4,254   $ 3,475   $ 13,249   $ 9,667   Contractual rent expense, including participation rent and excluding amortization of above and below-market ground leases and straight-line rent 3,315   3,475   9,805   9,667   The future impact of the shutdown on our level of liquidity is uncertain at this time. Measures undertaken by governments and companies in our principal markets have resulted in the temporary closure of many of our operating assets with the vast majority of the assets now open. The duration of such measures may impact our ability to collect rental income in our retail assets. The longer-term impact of the pandemic and resulting economic downturn could reduce demand for retail space. Consequently, we are reviewing, and where appropriate adjusting, our current capital expenditure and financing assumptions on existing and future projects to reflect any potential shorter- and longer-term impact of the global economic shutdown. We are also reviewing contractual arrangements with our tenants to assess the rights and responsibilities of the Company and our tenants in response to the impact of the measures undertaken by governments and/or tenants. Potential responses may include, but are not limited to, extension of payment terms from tenants, adjustments to the duration of leases, payment holidays, and renegotiation of lease terms. We expect to be able to refinance the majority of debt obligations maturing in the near term or to exercise contractual extension options thereon, although there is no guarantee we will be able to do so. In certain instances, we plan to seek certain modifications to mortgages, including lease restructuring approvals and technical default waivers, and potentially interest deferrals. In addition, certain debt obligations are subject to financial covenants. As a result, in the shorter-term, the global economic shutdown may negatively impact our ability to meet such covenants. We are reviewing the financial covenants of each debt instrument and, where applicable, working with our lenders to address debt instruments which may potentially approach or breach covenant limits. Such adjustments may include, but are not limited to, adjustment to the covenant limits, interest payment holidays, and temporary suspension of covenant testing. In order to maintain financial flexibility, we maintain capacity under the Facility. As of September 30, 2020, the available liquidity under such credit facility was $ 580.0  million. We believe we will be able to continue to borrow funds on the Facility when and as required. NOTE 18     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company repurchased  2,613,565  shares of Class A Stock at an average purchase price of $ 13.32  per share for an aggregate cost of approximately $ 34.8  million. Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company issued  1,469,319  shares of Class B-1 Stock at an average price of $ 21.39  per share, for total aggregate proceeds of $ 31.4  million. On October 30, 2020, the Company conveyed one property to the lender in satisfaction of $ 59.0  million in outstanding debt. 48 Table of Contents Brookfield Property REIT Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) On November 6, 2020, the Company extended its forbearance agreement related to the loan at The Mall in Columbia until November 23, 2020 while replacement financing is finalized. A principal repayment of $ 28.0  million was made in conjunction with the extension. 49 ITEM 2    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All references to numbered Notes are to specific footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report and which descriptions are incorporated into the applicable response by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with such Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have the same meanings as in such Notes. Brookfield Property REIT Inc. ("the Company" or "BPYU") is an indirect subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ("BPY"), one of the world's largest commercial real estate companies. As used herein, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to BPYU and its subsidiaries. BPYU, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is an owner and operator of retail properties. Overview—Introduction We own a property portfolio comprised primarily of Class A regional malls (defined primarily by sales per square foot). As of September 30, 2020, we were the owner, either entirely or with joint venture partners, of 122 retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately 120 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA. Our primary objective is to be an owner and operator of best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers and consumers. We operate our business to achieve this objective with a long term view and will continue to make decisions with that in mind, however, we will caution that in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or "the global economic shutdown" or "the shutdown") and its impact on the global economy, we may be unable to achieve these objectives in the near term.  Our strategy includes: • increasing the permanent occupancy of our regional mall portfolio by converting temporary leases to permanent leases and leasing vacant space; • renewing or replacing expiring leases at greater rental rates; • actively recycling capital through the disposition of assets; investing in whole or partial interests in high-quality regional malls, anchor pads, and our development pipeline and repaying debt; and • continuing to execute on our existing redevelopment projects and seeking additional opportunities within our portfolio for redevelopment. Despite the recent economic disruption caused by COVID-19, we expect that the high quality nature of our stabilized properties and associated cash flows will continue to be in demand from investors, although our ability to execute on recycling of capital initiatives will likely be impacted in the short term. As of September 30, 2020, the portfolio was 93.4% leased, compared to 95.0% leased at September 30, 2019. On a suite-to-suite basis, the leases commencing occupancy in the trailing 12 months exhibited initial rents that were 4.5% higher than the final rents paid on expiring leases. Overview—Financial The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, and has caused a global economic shutdown. The actions taken in response to the shutdown have interrupted business activities and supply chains; disrupted travel; contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets, resulting in a general decline in equity prices and lower interest rates; impacted social conditions; and adversely impacted local, regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor markets. Accordingly, we caution you that our financial position and consolidated performance presented below may not be indicative of our results in future periods as a result of the ongoing and developing COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on the global economy. Net loss attributable to BPYU increased from $229.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $461.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the increase in equity in loss of unconsolidated real estate  50 affiliates and the decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated properties from the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. See Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures below for a discussion of funds from operations ("FFO"), along with a reconciliation to Net (loss) income attributable to BPYU. Operating Metrics The following table summarizes selected operating metrics for our portfolio.

Lease Spread Metrics The following table summarizes signed leases compared to expiring leases in the same suite, for leases where (1) the downtime between new and previous tenant was less than 24 months, (2) the occupied space between the previous tenant and new tenant did not change by more than 10,000 square feet and (3) the new lease is at least a year.  # of Leases SF (in thousands) Term  (in years) Initial Rent PSF (1) Expiring Rent PSF (2) Initial Rent  Spread % Change Trailing 12 Month Commencements 870  3,109  6.6  $ 52.14  $ 49.90  $ 2.24  4.5  % (1)     Represents initial annual rent over the lease consisting of base minimum rent and common area maintenance. (2)     Represents expiring rent at end of lease consisting of base minimum rent and common area maintenance. Results of Operations   Three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019   Rental revenues increased $9.2 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $43.4 million increase in Rental Revenues during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. This is partially offset by the provision for doubtful accounts, resulting in a $32.2 million decrease from the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. Real estate taxes increased $7.3 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $4.7 million increase in real estate taxes during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019.  The provision of impairment of $38.8 million during the third quarter of 2019 is related to an impairment charge recorded on one operating property (Note 2). There were no operating property impairment charges during the third quarter of 2020. Depreciation and amortization increased $45.0 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $30.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. Gain from changes in control of investment properties of $39.7 million during the third quarter of 2019 is related to the acquisition of an additional interest at one operating property (Note 3).  51 Loss on extinguishment of debt of $27.5 million is related to the pre-payment penalty related to the refinancing of debt at one property that occurred in the third quarter of 2019 (Note 6). Benefit from (provision for) income taxes decreased $19.8 million, primarily due to the recognition of deferred taxes related to certain transactions effectuated in the BPY Transaction in 2019 Equity in loss of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates increased $60.3 million during the third quarter of 2020, primarily related to decreased revenues in unconsolidated joint ventures. Additionally, impairment charges of $2.5 million were recorded on one operating property (Note 5). Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment during the third quarter of 2019 is due to the 49.3% sale of our interest in Authentic Brands Group LLC ("ABG") (Note 3). Nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019   Rental revenues increased $64.9 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $139.2 million increase in Rental Revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This is partially offset by the provision for doubtful accounts, resulting in $48.2 million decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019.  Real estate taxes increased $20.6 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $14.1 million increase in real estate taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for impairment of $71.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is related to an impairment charges recorded on one operating property and the provision of impairment of $223.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 is related to impairment charges recorded on two operating properties (Note 2). Depreciation and amortization increased $128.0 million, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in four operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. The acquisition resulted in a $103.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019.  Loss from changes in control of investment properties of $15.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is related to the acquisition of an additional interest at one operating property (Note 3). The gain from changes in control of investment properties of $39.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 is related to the acquisition of an additional interest at one operating property (Note 3). The gain on extinguishment of debt of $14.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is related to the debt buyback transactions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020 (Note 6). The loss on extinguishment of debt of $27.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 is due to a pre-payment penalty related to the refinancing of debt at one property (Note 6). Benefit from income taxes decreased $10.7 million, primarily due to the recognition of deferred taxes related to certain transactions effectuated in the BPY Transaction in 2019. Equity in loss of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates of $105.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is primarily related to impairment charges on three operating properties (Note 5) and a loss of revenues. Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is primarily due to the sales of remaining interests in ABG and Aero OpCo LLC (Note 3). The Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 relates to the sale of our 12.0% interest in Bayside Marketplace and the 49.3% sale of our interest in ABG (Note 3). 52 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is from the ownership and management of our properties and strategic dispositions. In addition, we will also use financings as a source of capital. We may generate cash from refinancings or borrowings under our revolving credit facility (the "Facility"). Our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service, reinvestment in and redevelopment of properties, tenant allowances, dividends, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.   We anticipate maintaining financial flexibility by managing our future maturities and amortization of debt. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our commitments in the form of $173.3 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and $580.0 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2020, as well as anticipated cash provided by operations.  Our key financing objectives include: • to obtain property-secured debt with laddered maturities; and  • to minimize the amount of debt that is cross-collateralized and/or recourse to us. We may raise capital through public or private issuances of debt securities, preferred stock, Class A Stock, Common Units of BPR OP, LP ("BPROP"), or other capital raising activities. In addition, we or our affiliates may repurchase our shares or corporate debt and bonds. The future impact of the global economic shutdown on our level of liquidity is uncertain at this time. Measures undertaken by governments and companies in our principal markets have resulted in the temporary closure of many of our operating assets with the vast majority of the assets now open. The duration of such measures may impact our ability to collect rental income in our retail assets. The longer-term impact of the shutdown and resulting economic downturn could reduce demand for retail space. Consequently, we are reviewing, and where appropriate adjusting, our current capital expenditure and financing assumptions on existing and future projects to reflect any potential shorter- and longer-term impact of the shutdown. We are also reviewing contractual arrangements with our tenants to assess the rights and responsibilities of the Company and our tenants in response to the impact of the measures undertaken by governments and/or tenants. Potential responses may include, but are not limited to, extension of payment terms from tenants, adjustments to the duration of leases, payment holidays, and renegotiation of lease terms. We expect to be able to refinance the majority of debt obligations maturing in the near term or to exercise contractual extension options thereon, although there is no guarantee we will be able to do so. In certain instances, we plan to seek certain modifications to mortgages, including lease restructuring approvals and technical default waivers, and potentially interest deferrals. In addition, certain debt obligations are subject to financial covenants. As a result, in the shorter-term, the shutdown may negatively impact our ability to meet such covenants. We are reviewing the financial covenants of each debt instrument and, where applicable, working with our lenders to address debt instruments which may potentially approach or breach covenant limits. Such adjustments may include, but are not limited to, adjustment to the covenant limits, interest payment holidays, and temporary suspension of covenant testing. In order to maintain financial flexibility, we maintain capacity under our Facility. As at September 30, 2020, the available capacity under such credit facility was $580.0 million. We believe we will be able to continue to borrow funds on the Facility when and as required. The Company entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of August 24, 2018 consisting of the Facility, Term A-1 and A-2 loans, and a Term B loan. The Facility provides for revolving loans of up to $1.5 billion and borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Facility is scheduled to mature in August 2022 and had outstanding borrowings of $920.0 million as of September 30, 2020. The Term A-1 Loan has a total commitment outstanding of $900.0 million, with $700.0 million attributable to BPYU and $200.0 million attributable to an affiliate, and is scheduled to mature in August 2021, bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company didn't make principal payments, and the remaining outstanding balance was $34.8 million. The Term A-2 Loan has a total commitment outstanding of $2.0 billion and is scheduled to mature in August 2023, bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%, and the outstanding balance at September 30, 2020 was $2.0 billion. The Term B Loan has a total commitment outstanding of $2.0 billion and is scheduled to mature in August 2025 bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50 %. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company made a principal payment in the total amount of  53 $5.0 million. The total outstanding balance of the Term B Loan as of September 30, 2020 was $1,955.0 million. The Term A-1, A-2, and B Loans are contractually obligated to be prepaid through net proceeds from property level refinances and asset sales as outlined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which limit material changes in the nature of our business conducted, including, but not limited to, mergers, dissolutions or liquidations, dispositions of assets, liens, incurrence of additional indebtedness, dividends, transactions with affiliates, prepayment of subordinated debt, negative pledges and changes in fiscal periods. In addition, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants related to a maximum net debt-to-value ratio and a minimum fixed-charge-coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. On July 29, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment of its Credit Agreement in order to give effect to certain amendments, including, but not limited to the following: • The lenders have agreed to certain covenant relief in respect of the financial covenants through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021 (the “Covenant Relief Period”). The maximum total indebtedness to value ratio financial maintenance covenant is being eliminated permanently. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is being reduced to 1.20x during the Covenant Relief Period and increasing to 1.35x thereafter. • The applicable margin for the Term A Loans and the Facility will be LIBOR plus 3.00% during the Covenant Relief Period – and thereafter, will be LIBOR plus 3.00% if the total net indebtedness to value ratio is greater than 70%. • The Company agreed to maintain an ongoing liquidity covenant (set at $500 million) which will be tested as of the last day of each month against the amount of unrestricted cash, undrawn available amounts under the Facility and undrawn amounts under the new Brookfield Liquidity Facility. The Company will enter into and maintain a $500 million Brookfield Liquidity Facility (the “Brookfield Liquidity Facility”) and prior to the date the Company demonstrates compliance with the financial covenants in effect under the Credit Agreement prior to the First Amendment, any interest and principal payments thereunder must be paid-in-kind. • The Company will be required to "match-fund" drawings under the Facility in excess of $1.0 billion using proceeds of either the Brookfield Liquidity Facility or issuances of qualified equity interests. The match-funding requirement will be required to be made (i) monthly, whereby any drawing during that month is in excess of the prior highest balance of the revolver (in excess of $1.0 billion), (ii) within 10 business days of a request from the agent if as of any day during a month, the excess draw amount would exceed $10 million and (iii) at any time of request for a revolving loan that the excess would be $100 million or greater (which would be match-funded substantially concurrently with the requested revolving loan draw). • The Company will also be required to make additional prepayments of the Term A loans with proceeds of certain equity, debt issuances and asset sales. • The Company also agreed to a number of additional restrictions, including restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and the use of proceeds under the revolving facility, which will apply either through the end of the Covenant Relief Period – and in the case of certain provisions, until the Company demonstrates compliance with the financial covenants in effect under the Credit Agreement prior to the First Amendment. As of September 30, 2020, we are not aware of any instances of non-compliance with such covenants. Though there is potential for a risk of default (See Note 17 for discussion specific to COVID-19), in the event the Company fails to maintain compliance with its financial covenants, the Credit Agreement provides for a cure period, during which the Company has the opportunity to raise additional cash and reduce net debt balance, such as through capital contributions from BPY, or disposition of assets. Management has determined that in the event of a default, it is probable that these market-based alternatives would be available, and that these actions would provide the necessary cash flows to prevent or cure an event of default, although there is no guarantee that these market-based alternatives would be available. On May 24, 2020, the Company executed a series of transactions to repurchase corporate debt on the open market, funded by intercompany loans from BPY. The total amounts of debt repurchased had a par value of $59.6 million, and a cash repurchase price of $45.3 million. Following each repurchase, the repurchased debt was formally cancelled. As a result of the debt repurchase and cancellation, the Company recognized a gain of $14.3 million included in gain on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 54 During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on eighteen consolidated and unconsolidated property level mortgages, including one mortgage that is in maturity default. The Company is currently engaging in negotiations with the creditors on these mortgages to obtain potential lender concessions or other relief. If the Company is unsuccessful in obtaining concessions from these creditors, it is possible that the property securing these loans would be transferred to the lenders. In such circumstances, the carrying value of the property may no longer be recoverable and may trigger an impairment charge. These mortgages are non-recourse and the creditors do not have security claims against the Company aside from the collateral property. In total, as of September 30, 2020, the Company has suspended equity contributions to make contractual interest and/or principal payments on a total of $1.8 billion of property level mortgages and the related Investment in Real Estate securing these loans has a carrying value of $1.9 billion. On April 24, 2020, the Company completed a one-year extension of a $1.3 billion loan secured by cross-collateralized mortgages on 15 properties with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%, which matures on April 25, 2021. An extension fee of $1.6 million was paid in conjunction with the extension. On February 28, 2020, the Company closed a new loan at the Miami Design District joint venture in the amount of $500.0 million with an interest rate of 4.13%, which matures on March 1, 2030. The loan replaced the previous debt of $480.0 million with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50% that was scheduled to mature on May 14, 2021. As a result of the refinancing, the joint venture incurred $3.7 million of deferred financing costs that were capitalized. As of September 30, 2020, we had $8.2 billion of debt pre-payable at our proportionate share without penalty. We may pursue opportunities to refinance this debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities. As of September 30, 2020, our proportionate share of total debt aggregated $27.0 billion. Our total debt includes our consolidated debt of $16.5 billion and our share of unconsolidated real estate affiliates debt of $10.4 billion. Of our proportionate share of total debt, $6.8 billion is recourse to the Company or its subsidiaries (including the Facility) due to guarantees or other security provisions for the benefit of the note holder.   The amount of debt due in the next three years represents 30.2% of our total debt at maturity. The maximum amount due in any one of the next ten years is no more than $3.7 billion at our proportionate share or approximately of 13.7% our total debt at maturity. The following table illustrates the scheduled payments for our proportionate share of total debt as of September 30, 2020. The $206.2 million of junior subordinated notes are due in 2036, but we may redeem them any time after April 30, 2011 (Note 6). As we do not expect to redeem the notes prior to maturity, they are included in the consolidated debt maturing subsequent to 2025.

(2)    Includes the Term A-2 Loan (Note 6). (3)    Includes the Term B Loan (Note 6). We believe we will be able to extend the maturity date, repay under our available line of credit or refinance the consolidated debt that is scheduled to mature in 2020. We also believe that the joint ventures will be able to refinance the debt of our unconsolidated real estate affiliates upon maturity; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure such debt on acceptable terms or otherwise, or that joint venture operations or contributions by us and/or our partners will be sufficient to repay such loans. 55 Reserves  With respect to our consolidated properties, for the  three and nine  months ended  September 30, 2020 , we have recorded $36.9 million and $59.8 million, respectively, associated with potentially uncollectible revenues, which includes $2.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables. With respect to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates, for the  three and nine  months ended  September 30, 2020 , our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates have recorded $47.4 million and $81.0 million, respectively, associated with potentially uncollectible revenues, which includes $3.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables. Of these amounts for the  three and nine  months ended  September 30, 2020,  our share totaled $24.9 million and $40.1 million, respectively, which includes $1.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, for straight-line rent receivables.  As of September 30, 2020, the Company, including consideration of our share of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates, has collected approximately 65% of third quarter rents, and collections continue to increase subsequent to quarter end. While working to preserve our profitability and cash flow, we are also working with our tenants regarding requests for lease concessions and other forms of assistance, although we have not executed a significant number of agreements. While we anticipate that we may grant further rent concessions, such as the deferral or abatement of lease payments, such rent concession requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Not all requests for rent relief will be granted as the Company does not intend to forgo its legally enforceable contractual rights that exist under its lease agreements. Acquisitions and Joint Venture Activity From time-to-time we may acquire whole or partial interests in high-quality retail properties or make strategic dispositions. Refer to Note 3 for more information. 56 Developments and Redevelopments   We are currently redeveloping several consolidated and unconsolidated properties primarily to improve the productivity and value of the property, convert large-scale anchor boxes into smaller leasable areas and to create new in-line retail space and new restaurant venues. The execution of these redevelopment projects within our portfolio was identified as providing compelling risk-adjusted returns on investment. We have development and redevelopment activities totaling approximately $445.0 million under construction and $365.0 million in the pipeline. We continue to evaluate a number of other redevelopment projects to further enhance the quality of our assets. Expected returns are based on the completion of current and future redevelopment projects, and the success of the leasing and asset management plans in place for each project. Expected returns are subject to a number of variables, risks, and uncertainties including those disclosed within Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report and those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. We also refer the reader to our disclosure related to forward-looking statements, below.

Our investment in these projects for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased from December 31, 2019 in conjunction with the applicable development plan and as projects near completion. The continued progression of redevelopment projects resulted in increases to our investment to date. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our current projects were generally progressing in accordance with their timeline and budget. The impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions that have been put in place by local governments may cause delays in construction and may impact our ability to progress pre-leasing efforts. 57 Capital Expenditures, Capitalized Interest and Overhead (at share) The following table illustrates our capital expenditures, capitalized interest, and initial direct costs associated with leasing and development, which primarily relate to ordinary capital projects at our operating properties. In addition, we incurred tenant allowances and capitalized leasing costs for our operating properties as outlined below. Capitalized interest is based upon qualified expenditures and interest rates; capitalized leasing and development costs  are initial direct costs as incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.  These costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the related asset.   Nine Months Ended September 30,   2020 2019   (Dollars in thousands) Operating capital expenditures (1) $ 93,606  $ 122,537  Tenant allowances and capitalized leasing costs (2) 59,598  149,234  Capitalized interest and capitalized overhead 16,149  17,848  Total $ 169,353  $ 289,619  (1) Reflects only non-tenant operating capital expenditures.

Seasonality Although we have a year-long temporary leasing program, occupancies for short-term tenants and, therefore, rental income recognized, are higher during the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, the majority of our tenants have December or January lease years for purposes of calculating annual overage rent amounts. Accordingly, overage rent thresholds are most commonly achieved in the fourth quarter. As a result, revenue production is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making  60 judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A disclosure of our critical accounting policies which affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is included in our Annual Report in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, there were no significant changes to these policies, except for the policies related to the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02,  Leases  ("ASC 842", "Topic 842", or "the new leasing standard") as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as described in Note 2 and below. Topic 842 - Lease Modification Q&A Due to the business disruptions and challenges severely affecting the global economy caused by the global economic shutdown, lessors may provide rent deferrals and other lease concessions to lessees. In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board staff issued a question and answer document (the "Lease Modification Q&A") focused on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the shutdown. Under existing lease guidance, economic relief that is agreed to or negotiated outside of the original lease agreement is typically considered a lease modification, in which case both the lessee and lessor would be required to apply the respective modification frameworks. However, if the lessee was entitled to the economic relief because of either contractual or legal rights, the relief would be accounted for outside of the modification framework. Although the original lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842,  Leases  remain appropriate to address routine lease modifications, the Lease Modification Q&A established a different framework to account for certain lease concessions granted in response to the shutdown. The Lease Modification Q&A allows the Company, if certain criteria have been met, to make an accounting policy election to account for COVID-19 related lease concessions as either a lease modification or a negative variable adjustment to rental revenue. Such election is required to be applied consistently to leases with similar characteristics and similar circumstances.  The Company has elected to apply such relief and will avail itself of the election to treat leases as lease modifications, thereby avoiding performing a lease by lease analysis for the lease concessions that were (1) granted as relief due to the shutdown and (2) result in the cash flows remaining substantially the same or less than the original contract. Refer also to the accounting policies discussed in Note 2. REIT Requirements In order to remain qualified as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable ordinary income to stockholders. We are also subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements. Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures and Definitions Funds From Operations ("FFO")  The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by Nareit. The Company determines FFO to be its share of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to BPYU computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for real estate related depreciation and amortization, amortization of above and below market rent on ground leases, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding cumulative effects of accounting changes, excluding gains and losses from the sales of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon the Company's economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.  The Company considers FFO a helpful supplemental measure of the operating performance for equity REITs and a complement to GAAP measures because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry. FFO facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of the Company's properties between periods because it does not give effect to real  61 estate depreciation and amortization since these amounts are computed to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Since values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides investors with a clearer view of the Company's operating performance.  We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the Nareit definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO in accordance with Nareit guidance. In addition, although FFO is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs.  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures In order to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the Company's non-GAAP financial measures of FFO, a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to BPYU to FFO has been provided. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measure does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to BPYU and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow. In addition, the Company has presented such financial measures on a consolidated and unconsolidated basis (at the Company's proportionate share) as the Company believes that given the significance of the Company's operations that are owned through investments accounted for by the equity method of accounting, the detail of the operations of the Company's unconsolidated properties provides important insights into the income and FFO produced by such investments. The following table reconciles GAAP net income attributable to BPYU to FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net loss Attributable to BPYU $ (170,620) $ (33,423) $ (461,497) $ (228,988) Provision for impairment excluded from FFO - Consolidated Properties —  38,941  71,455  223,287  Provision for impairment excluded from FFO - Unconsolidated Properties 2,470  —  45,145  —  Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment —  —  —  (104,354) Gain on sales of investment properties (1,824) (5,093) (8,474) (10,640) Above and below market ground rent 939  —  3,444  —  Preferred stock dividends (3,984) (3,984) (11,952) (11,952) Loss (gain) from changes in control of investment properties and other —  (39,712) 15,433  (39,712) Depreciation and amortization of capitalized real estate costs - Consolidated Properties 160,379  115,490  471,106  343,054  Depreciation and amortization of capitalized real estate costs - Unconsolidated Properties 114,527  131,987  344,720  406,818  Allocation of noncontrolling interests (1) (27,671) (24,177) (93,019) (98,425) FFO  $ 74,216  $ 180,029  $ 376,361  $ 479,088  (1)    Noncontrolling interest holders' share of adjustments including depreciation, impairment, gain (loss) from changes in control of investment properties and other, Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment and gain on sales of investment properties.  Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Statements that do not relate to historical or current facts or matters are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "may," "will," "seek," "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "targets," "intends," "should," "estimates," "could," "continue," "assume," "projects," "plans," or similar expressions,  62 are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statement are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the recent novel coronavirus outbreak. Our future results may be impacted by risks associated with the global economic shutdown and the related global reduction in commerce and travel and substantial volatility in stock markets worldwide, which may result in a decrease of cash flows and impairment losses on our investments and real estate properties, and we may be unable to achieve our expected returns. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements.  Some of the other risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  • the market price of BPY units and the combined business performance of BPY as a whole; • general volatility of conditions affecting the retail sector; • our inability to acquire and maintain tenants or to lease space on terms favorable to us; • risks related to the bankruptcy or store closures of national tenants with chains of stores in many of our properties; • our inability to sell real estate quickly; • risks related to perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties; • risks related to the development, expansion and acquisitions of properties; • risks related to competition in our business; • risks related to natural disasters, pandemics/epidemics or terrorist attacks;  • risks related to cyber and data security breaches or information technology failures; • environmental uncertainties and related costs, including costs resulting from uninsured potential losses; • general risks related to inflation or deflation; • risks relating to impairment charges for our real estate assets; • risks related to conflicts of interest with BPY and our status as a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq; • our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash; • risks related to our joint venture partners, including risks related to conflicts of interests, potential bankruptcies, tax-related obligations and financial support relating to such joint venture partners; • our inability to maintain status as a REIT, and possible adverse changes to tax laws;  • risks related to our indebtedness and debt restrictions and covenants; • our inability to refinance, extend, restructure or repay near and indeterminate debt;  • our inability to raise capital through financing activities or asset sales; and • risks related to the structure and trading of Class A Shares. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties in our Annual Report and our quarterly periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company may update that discussion in its periodic reports, but otherwise takes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.  ITEM 3        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR. The Company is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be published or precisely how SOFR will be calculated and published. Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form. The Company has contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest amounts on our variable rate debt and the swap rate for our interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 6 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable. In the event that LIBOR is discontinued, the interest rates will be based on a fallback reference rate specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon. Such an event would not affect the Company’s ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps, but the alternative reference rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR. 63 Certain risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative reference rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require substantial negotiation with each respective counterparty. If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative reference rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the method of calculating LIBOR changes from its current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. ITEM 4          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, dated August 27, 2018, among us, BAM and other parties thereto (the "Master Services Agreement"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us pursuant to the Master Services Agreement have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. 64 PART II      OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the normal course of business, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings relating to the ownership and operations of our properties. In management's opinion, the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  The Company is subject to litigation related to the BPY Transaction. The Company cannot predict the outcome of pending litigation, nor can it predict the amount of time and expense that it will be required to resolve such litigation. ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORS The following risk factors supplement the risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, and should be read in conjunction with the other risk factors presented in the Annual Report. In the near term, we expect to be impacted by the ongoing and developing COVID-19 pandemic, which has interrupted business activities and supply chains; disrupted travel; contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets, resulting in a general decline in equity prices and lower interest rates; impacted social conditions; and adversely impacted local, regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor markets. Public Health Risk Our business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases. As a result of the rapid spread of COVID-19, many companies and various governments have imposed restrictions on business activity and travel which may continue and could expand. Business has slowed around the globe including in our retail business, and there can be no assurance that strategies to address potential disruptions in operations will mitigate the adverse impacts related to the outbreak. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19, it is difficult to predict how significant the impact of this coronavirus outbreak, including any responses to it, will be on the global economy, our company and our business or for how long disruptions are likely to continue. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of this coronavirus and actions taken to contain the COVID-19 or its impact, among others. Such developments, depending on their nature, duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We operate in industries or geographies impacted by COVID-19. Many of these are facing financial and operational hardships due to COVID-19 and responses to it. Adverse impacts on our business may include: • a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government or tenant action; • a slowdown in business activity may severely impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to fund their business operations, meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; • an increase in re-leasing timelines, potential delays in lease-up of vacant space and the market rates at which such lease will be executed; • reduced economic activity could result in a prolonged recession, which could negatively impact consumer discretionary spending; and • expected completion dates for our development and redevelopment projects may be subject to delay as a result of local economic conditions that may continue to be disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these and potential other disruptions caused by COVID-19 continue, our business could be materially adversely affected. Credit Risk The recent global economic shutdown has increased the risk in the near-term of our tenants’ ability to fulfill lease commitments, which has been materially impacted by retail store closures, quarantines and stay-at-home orders. Many of our tenants could declare bankruptcy or become insolvent and cease business operations as a result of prolonged mitigation efforts. 65 Lease Roll-over Risk Lease roll-over risk arises from the possibility that we may experience difficulty renewing leases as they expire or in re-leasing space vacated by tenants upon early lease expiry. Due to the shutdown, we may experience an increase in re-leasing timelines, potential delays in lease-up of vacant space and the market rates at which such leases will be executed could be impacted.  Economic Risk Real estate is relatively illiquid and may be even more illiquid in the context of an economic downturn that may result from the global economic shutdown. Such illiquidity may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Also, financial difficulties of other property owners resulting in distressed sales could depress real estate values in the markets in which we operate. Interest Rate and Financing Risk We have an on-going need to access debt markets to refinance maturing debt as it comes due. There is a risk that lenders will not refinance such maturing debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us or on any terms at all. This risk may be increased as a result of disrupted market conditions resulting from the shutdown. Our strategy to stagger the maturities of our mortgage portfolio attempts to mitigate our exposure to excessive amounts of debt maturing in any one year and to maintain relationships with a large number of lenders to limit exposure to any one counterparty.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements presented in this report include the accounts of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("HomeTrust"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, HomeTrust Bank (the "Bank"). As used throughout this report, the term the "Company" refers to HomeTrust and the Bank, its consolidated subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. It is recommended that these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2021  ("2021 Form 10-K") filed with the SEC on September 10, 2021. The results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions, and other subjective assessments. In particular, management has identified the determination of the provision and the allowance for credit losses on loans as an accounting policy that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in this policy, is critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements. This policy and the related judgments, estimates and assumptions is described in greater detail in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Critical Accounting Policies) in the 2021 Form 10-K. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the financial statements to this critical accounting policy, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Further, subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on this estimate and the Company's financial condition and operating results in future periods. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant, unprecedented disruption around the world that has affected daily living and negatively impacted the global economy. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may meaningfully impact significant estimates such as the allowance for credit losses or certain loan concentrations in the hospitality and healthcare industries.  See "Note 6 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans" for more information on loans that have been modified or are in deferral due to COVID-19. Reclassifications and corrections.  To maintain consistency and comparability, certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation with no effect on net income or stockholders’ equity as previously reported. 2.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adoption of New Accounting Standards ASU 2020-01, "Investment—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815."  This ASU clarified the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under Topic 815. The amendments in this ASU were effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2021 and early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Newly Issued but Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards ASU 2021-05, "Leases (Topic 842): Lessors—Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments."  This ASU amends the lease classification requirements for lessors to classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease that would result in the recognition of a day-one loss at lease commencement, provided that the lease includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. When a lease is classified as operating, the lessor does not recognize a net investment in the lease, does not derecognize the underlying asset and therefore, does not recognize a selling profit or loss. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 10 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

There were  no  gross realized gains or losses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Debt securities available for sale with amortized costs totaling $ 55,636  and $ 52,603  and market values of $ 56,267  and $ 53,897  at December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure various public deposits and other borrowings. 11 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) The gross unrealized losses and the fair value for debt securities available for sale aggregated by the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 were as follows:   December 31, 2021 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses U.S. government agencies $ 14,864   $ ( 136 ) $ —   $ —   $ 14,864   $ ( 136 ) MBS, residential 9,344   ( 100 ) 1,132   ( 21 ) 10,476   ( 121 ) Corporate bonds 43,619   ( 345 ) —   —   43,619   ( 345 ) Total $ 67,827   $ ( 581 ) $ 1,132   $ ( 21 ) $ 68,959   $ ( 602 ) June 30, 2021 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses U.S. government agencies $ 14,963   $ ( 37 ) $ —   $ —   $ 14,963   $ ( 37 ) MBS, residential 5,212   ( 28 ) 1,205   ( 26 ) 6,417   ( 54 ) Corporate bonds 19,873   ( 127 ) —   —   19,873   ( 127 ) Total $ 40,048   $ ( 192 ) $ 1,205   $ ( 26 ) $ 41,253   $ ( 218 ) The total number of securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 were  39  and  28 , respectively. Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 continue to perform as scheduled and management does not believe that there is a credit loss or that a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of management's evaluation of its intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, management considers its investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. Management does not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that securities will be required to be sold. See "Note 1 – Summary of Significant Account Policies" in our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion. Management continues to monitor all of its securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that management will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on investment securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued interest receivable for debt securities available for sale was $ 529 . 4.     Other Investments Other investments, at cost, consist of the following at the dates indicated:  December 31, 2021 June 30, 2021 FHLB of Atlanta stock $ 2,965   $ 6,153   FRB stock 7,403   7,386   SBIC investments 11,749   10,171   Total $ 22,117   $ 23,710   As a requirement for membership, the Bank invests in the stock of both the FHLB of Atlanta and the FRB. No ready market exists for these securities so carrying value, or cost, approximates their fair value based on the redemption provisions of the FHLB of Atlanta and the FRB, respectively. SBIC investments are equity securities without a readily determinable fair value and are recorded at cost.   12 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

All qualifying one-to-four family first mortgage loans, HELOCs, commercial real estate loans, and FHLB of Atlanta stock are pledged as collateral by a blanket pledge to secure any outstanding FHLB advances. Loans are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis and the composition of the loans outstanding by credit quality indicator is provided below. Loan credit quality indicators are developed through review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis. Generally, loans are monitored for performance on a quarterly basis with the credit quality indicators adjusted as needed. The indicators represent the rating for loans as of the date presented based on the most recent assessment performed. These credit quality indicators are defined as follows: Pass —A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification. Special Mention —A special mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification. Substandard —A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful —An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Loss —Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuing to be carried as an asset is not warranted. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to no potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not appropriate to defer a full write-off even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. 14 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) The following table presents loans that were modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default during the periods indicated below: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Number of Loans Recorded Investment Number of Loans Recorded Investment Other TDRs:         Retail consumer:         Indirect auto finance —   $ —   1   $ 1   Total —   $ —   1   $ 1   Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Number of Loans Recorded Investment Number of Loans Recorded Investment Other TDRs:         Retail consumer:         Indirect auto finance 2   44   2   $ 12   Total 2   $ 44   2   $ 12   Other TDRs include TDRs that have a below market interest rate and extended payment terms. The Company does not typically forgive principal when restructuring troubled debt. In determining the ACL, management considers TDRs for all loan classes, and the subsequent nonperformance in accordance with their modified terms, by measuring a reserve on a loan-by-loan basis based on either the value of the loan's expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or on the collateral value, net of the estimated costs of disposal, if the loan is collateral dependent. Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposure The Company maintains a separate reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of ECLs on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, utilizing the same models and approaches for the Company's other loan portfolio segments described above, as these unfunded commitments share similar risk characteristics as its loan portfolio segments. The Company has identified the unfunded portion of certain lines of credit as unconditionally cancellable credit exposures, meaning the Company can cancel the unfunded commitment at any time. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures included in other liabilities was $ 2,088 . Modifications in Response to COVID-19  Beginning in March 2020, the Company began offering short-term loan modifications to assist borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act along with a joint agency statement issued by banking agencies and confirmed by FASB staff that short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 were not considered TDRs; however, the relief offered by the CARES Act ended December 31, 2021. The Bank offered payment and financial relief programs for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. These programs included loan payment deferrals for up to 90 days (which could be renewed for another 90 days under certain circumstances), waived late fees, and suspension of foreclosure proceedings and repossessions. Since March 2020, the Company received numerous requests from borrowers for some type of payment relief; however, the majority of these payment deferrals have ended and borrowers are again making regular loan payments. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 652  in loans with full principal and interest payment deferrals related to COVID-19 compared to $ 107  at June 30, 2021. Substantially all loans placed on full payment deferral during the pandemic have come out of deferral and borrowers are either making regular loan payments or interest-only payments. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 15,604  in commercial loan deferrals on interest-only payments compared to $ 78,850  at June 30, 2021. 24 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

Equity Incentive Plan The Company provides stock-based awards through the  2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan , which  provides for awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights and cash awards to directors, directors emeritus, officers, employees and advisory directors . The cost of equity-based awards under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the plan is  2,962,400 , including  2,116,000  for stock options and stock appreciation rights and  846,400  for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Shares of common stock issued under the plan would be issued out of authorized but unissued shares, some or all of which may be repurchased shares. The Company repurchased a number of shares on the open market sufficient to cover awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units available to be granted under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, for $ 13,297 , at an average cost of $ 15.71  per share during the year ended June 30, 2013.

Commitments and Contingencies Loan Commitments  – Legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, loan commitments (excluding $ 201,032  and $ 277,600  of undisbursed portions of construction loans) totaled $ 78,875  and $ 123,463  of which $ 22,199  and $ 45,270  were variable rate commitments and $ 56,676  and $ 78,193  were fixed rate commitments. The fixed rate loans had interest rates ranging from  1.08 % to  8.56 % at December 31, 2021 and  2.50 % to  8.36 % at June 30, 2021, and terms ranging from  three  to  30  years. Pre-approved but unused lines of credit (principally second mortgage home equity loans and overdraft protection loans) totaled $ 539,778  and $ 530,505  at December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. These amounts represent the Company's exposure to credit risk, and in the opinion of management have no more than the normal lending risk that the Company commits to its borrowers. The Company has two types of commitments related to certain one-to-four family loans held for sale: rate lock commitments and forward loan commitments. Rate lock commitments are commitments to extend credit to a customer that has an interest rate lock and are considered derivative instruments. The rate lock commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting. In order to mitigate the risk from interest rate fluctuations, the Company enters into forward loan sale commitments on a “best efforts” basis, which do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument. The fair value of these interest rate lock commitments was not material at December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2021. The Company grants construction and permanent loans collateralized primarily by residential and commercial real estate to customers throughout its primary market areas. In addition, the Company grants equipment financing throughout the United States and municipal financing to customers throughout North and South Carolina. The Company’s loan portfolio can be affected by the general economic conditions within these market areas. Management believes that the Company has no significant concentration of credit in the loan portfolio. Restrictions on Cash  – In response to COVID-19, the FRB reduced the reserve requirements to zero on March 15, 2020. Prior to this change the Bank was required by regulation to maintain a varying cash reserve balance with the FRB.  Guarantees  – Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable and payment is only guaranteed upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary. Total commitments under standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 were $ 9,496  and $ 8,681 , respectively. There was no liability recorded for these letters of credit at December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2021, respectively. Litigation  –   From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested, and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. These claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to actions to enforce liens on properties in which the Company holds a security interest. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations . 10.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. Debt securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The Company measures the fair value of loans receivable under the exit price notion. The fair value of nonperforming loans is based on the underlying value of the collateral. Fair Value Hierarchy The Company groups assets at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: Level 1:    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2:    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3:    Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 27 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

For real estate loans, the fair value of the loan's collateral is determined by a third party appraisal, which is then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral (typically ranging from  8 % to  12 % of the appraised value). For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. Additional discounts of  5 % to  15 % may be applied depending on the age of the appraisals. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual asset with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. For non-real estate loans, the fair value of the loan's collateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower's financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the customer and customer's business. 28 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 11.     Leases As Lessee - Operating Leases The Company's operating leases primarily include office space and bank branches. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term up to  15  additional years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at management's sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in estimating the value of the ROU and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Most of the Company's lease agreements include periodic rate adjustments for inflation. The depreciable life of ROU assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the shorter of the useful life or the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes lease expenses for these leases over the lease term. The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases. ROU assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in other liabilities.

The Company's equipment finance leases consist mainly of construction, transportation, medical, and manufacturing equipment. Many of its operating and finance leases offer the lessee the option to purchase the equipment at fair value or for a nominal fixed purchase option; and most of the leases that do not have a nominal purchase option include renewal provisions resulting in some leases continuing beyond initial contractual terms. The Company's leases do not include early termination options, and continued rent payments are due if leased equipment is not returned at the end of the lease.  As Lessor - Operating Leases Operating lease income is recognized as a component of noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms range from  one  to  five  years. Assets related to operating leases are included in other assets and the corresponding depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis as a component of other noninterest expense. The net book value of leased assets totaled $ 23,869  and $ 25,932  with a residual value of $ 14,800  and $ 15,330  as of December 31, 2021 and  June 30, 2021 , respectively.

Many of the forward-looking statements are based upon management's beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this report or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this report might not occur and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. As used throughout this report, the terms "we", "our", "us", "HomeTrust Bancshares" and the "Company" refer to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, HomeTrust Bank (the "Bank"), unless the context indicates otherwise. Overview HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the holding company for HomeTrust Bank in connection with the Bank’s conversion from mutual to stock form, which was completed on July 10, 2012 (the “Conversion”). As a bank holding company and financial holding company, we are regulated by the Federal Reserve. As a North Carolina state-chartered bank, and member of the FRB, the Bank's primary regulators are the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Bank's deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of the 12 regional banks in the FHLB System. Our headquarters is located in Asheville, North Carolina. Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, equipment finance leases, municipal leases, loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences including home equity loans, construction and land/lot loans, indirect automobile loans, and other consumer loans. We also originate one-to-four family loans, SBA loans, and HELOCs to sell to third parties. In addition, we invest in debt securities issued by United States Government agencies and GSEs, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit in other banks insured by the FDIC. We offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. We are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that is paid on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. Because the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures put in place to address its economic consequences are unknown, including the 150 basis point reduction in the targeted federal funds rate during 2020, until the pandemic subsides, we expect our net interest income and net interest margin to be adversely affected throughout fiscal 2022 and possibly longer. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, lease income, gain on the sale of loans held for sale, and gains and losses from sales of debt securities. An offset to net interest income is the provision for credit losses which is required to establish and maintain the ACL. All financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet credit exposures, including loans, investment securities and unfunded commitments are evaluated for credit losses. See "Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 1 of our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion. Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, and computer services. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities. Our geographic footprint includes seven markets obtained through numerous strategic acquisitions as well as two de novo commercial loan offices. Looking forward, we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise. While COVID-19 has dampened our growth activities, we believe as the local and global economies return to normalcy the Company remains in a position to create growth. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on growth in our current market areas. 34 At December 31, 2021, we had over 30 locations in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, the "Piedmont" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley). During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we closed nine branches located in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances which could include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. The following represents our critical accounting policy: Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on Loans.   The ACL reflects our estimate of credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. We charge off loans against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. We use a systematic methodology to determine our ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. We consider the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The estimate of our ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, our process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. Our ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects our best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. We recognize in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. Our ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include: tangible book value; tangible book value per share, tangible equity to tangible assets ratio; and the ratio of the ACL to total loans excluding PPP loans. Management has presented the non-GAAP financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes including these items provides useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations while facilitating the comparison of the quality and composition of our earnings over time and in comparison to our competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, are not audited and are not a substitute for operating results or any analysis determined in accordance with GAAP. Where applicable, we have also presented comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies. See “Comparison of Results of Operations" for more detailed information about our financial performance for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Total assets and liabilities decreased by $21.9 million and $27.1 million down to $3.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021 as compared to June 30, 2021. The decrease in assets was primarily driven by a combined decrease of $56.9 million, or 23.0%, in cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit in other banks, and debt securities available for sale, and a $37.2 million, or 1.4%, decrease in loans receivable as the Company redirected its excess liquidity to continue paying down borrowings during the period. These decreases were partially offset by a $64.6 million, or 34.1%, increase in commercial paper and a $8.5 million, or 9.1%, increase in loans held for sale. Cash and cash equivalents and commercial paper.   Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 31.7%, to $34.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $51.0 million at June 30, 2021. Commercial paper increased $64.6 million, or 34.1%, to $254.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $189.6 million at June 30, 2021 which was funded by excess interest-earning deposits and a decrease in debt securities available for sale.  Debt securities available for sale and other investments.   Debt securities available for sale decreased $34.6 million, or 22.1%, to $121.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $156.5 million at June 30, 2021. At December 31, 2021, certificates of deposit in other banks decreased $6.1 million, or 15.3%, to $34.0 million compared to $40.1 million at June 30, 2021. The decrease in certificates of deposit in other banks was due to $7.1 million in maturities partially offset by $1.0 million in purchases. All certificates of deposit in other banks are fully insured by the FDIC. Other investments at cost decreased $1.6 million, or 6.7%, to $22.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $23.7 million at June 30, 2021. Other investments at cost included SBIC investments, FRB stock, and FHLB stock totaling $11.7 million, $7.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively. The overall decrease was driven by a $3.2 million, or 51.8%, reduction in FHLB stock as a result of the paydowns in borrowings during the current period. Loans held for sale.    Loans held for sale increased $8.6 million, or 9.1%, to $102.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $93.5 million at June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by a $17.1 million, or 29.7%, increase in HELOCs originated for sale, a $12.6 million, or 39.6%, decrease in mortgage loans held for sale, and a $4.1 million, or 97.6%, increase in SBA loans held for sale.  Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs.   Total loans decreased $37.2 million, or 1.4%, to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 from the balance at June 30, 2021. The decrease was driven by a $88.5 million, or 11.6%, decrease in retail consumer loans resulting from a reduction in one-to-four family loans and indirect auto finance loans, partially as a result of the sale of $11.5 million of these loans in November 2021. This decrease was partially offset by a $78.9 million, or 4.1%, increase in commercial loans (excluding PPP loans) as the Company continues its focus on the growth of this loan segment. 36 Commercial and retail consumer loans consist of the following at the dates indicated: As of Percent of total (Dollars in thousands) December 31, June 30, Change December 31, June 30, 2021 2021 $ % 2021 2021 Commercial loans: Commercial real estate $ 1,113,330  $ 1,142,276  $ (28,946) (2.5) % 41.3  % 41.8  % Construction and development 226,439  179,427  47,012  26.2  8.4  6.6  Commercial and industrial 162,396  141,341  21,055  14.9  6.0  5.2  Equipment finance 367,008  317,920  49,088  15.4  13.6  11.6  Municipal leases 131,078  140,421  (9,343) (6.7) 4.9  5.1  PPP loans 19,044  46,650  (27,606) (59.2) 0.7  1.7  Total commercial loans 2,019,295  1,968,035  51,260  2.6  74.9  72.0  Retail consumer loans: One-to-four family 356,850  406,549  (49,699) (12.2) 13.2  14.9  HELOCs - originated 128,189  130,225  (2,036) (1.6) 4.8  4.8  HELOCs - purchased 30,795  38,976  (8,181) (21.0) 1.1  1.4  Construction and land/lots 69,253  66,027  3,226  4.9  2.6  2.4  Indirect auto finance 84,581  115,093  (30,512) (26.5) 3.1  4.2  Consumer 7,109  8,362  (1,253) (15.0) 0.3  0.3  Total retail consumer loans 676,777  765,232  (88,455) (11.6) 25.1  28.0  Total loans $ 2,696,072  $ 2,733,267  $ (37,195) (1.4) % 100.0  % 100.0  % Asset quality.   Nonperforming assets decreased by $6.6 million, or 51.4%, to $6.2 million, or 0.18%, of total assets at December 31, 2021 compared to $12.8 million, or 0.36% of total assets at June 30, 2021. The significant decrease from June 30, 2021 was primarily a result of the payoff of two commercial real estate loan relationships totaling $5.1 million in the prior quarter. Nonperforming assets included $6.2 million in nonaccruing loans and $45,000 in REO at December 31, 2021, compared to $12.6 million and $188,000 in nonaccruing loans and REO, respectively, at June 30, 2021. Nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.23% at December 31, 2021 and 0.46% at June 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had $652,000 in loans with full principal and interest payment deferrals related to COVID-19 compared to $107,000 at June 30, 2021. Substantially all loans placed on full payment deferral during the pandemic have come out of deferral and borrowers are either making regular loan payments or interest-only payments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $15.6 million in commercial loan deferrals on interest-only payments compared to $78.9 million at June 30, 2021. We believe the steps we have taken and continue to take are necessary to effectively manage our portfolio and assist our customers through the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the duration, impact and government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we will continue to work with our customers to determine the best option for repayment of accrued interest on the deferred payments.  The ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to 0.65% at December 31, 2021 from 0.76% at June 30, 2021. Classified assets decreased $3.8 million, or 14.2%, to $22.9 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $26.7 million at June 30, 2021 primarily due to the payoff of two commercial real estate loan relationships discussed above. The Company's overall asset quality metrics continue to demonstrate its commitment to growing and maintaining a loan portfolio with a moderate risk profile; however, the Company will remain diligent in its monitoring of the portfolio during these uncertain times. Our individually evaluated loans include loans on nonaccrual status and all TDRs, whether performing or on nonaccrual status under their restructured terms. Individually evaluated loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either the discounted cash flow or the collateral valuation method. As of December 31, 2021, there were $5.3 million in loans individually evaluated. For more information on these individually evaluated loans, see "Note 6 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Allowance for credit losses.   The ACL on loans was $30.9 million, or 1.15%, of total loans at December 31, 2021 compared to $35.5 million, or 1.30%, of total loans at June 30, 2021. The overall decrease was driven by lower expected credit losses estimated by management based on an improving economic outlook. There was a net benefit for credit losses of $4.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, compared to a $2.1 million net benefit for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2021. Net loan charge-offs totaled $760,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, compared to net charge-offs of $637,000 for the same period last year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.05% for the six months ended   December 31, 2021 compared to net charge-offs of 0.04% for the corresponding period last year. The allowance as a percentage of nonaccruing loans increased to 500.70% at December 31, 2021 from 281.38% at June 30, 2021.  37 Deferred income taxes.  Deferred income taxes decreased $4.9 million, or 28.9%, to $12.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $16.9 million at June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily a result of a release and reduction of the ACL, depreciation on new equipment finance leases, and bonus tax depreciation on new premises. Other assets.   Other assets increased $1.4 million, or 2.5%, to $58.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $57.5 million at June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by a reclassification of assets held for sale from premises and equipment related to the nine branch closures, partially offset by lower net operating lease assets and lower current taxes receivable.  Deposits.   Deposits increased $43.2 million, or 1.5%, during the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $3.0 billion, driven by our successful efforts to increase core deposits which increased $74.1 million, or 3.0%. Partially offsetting this deposit increase was a decrease of $31.0 million, or 6.5%, in certificates of deposit as part of our managed runoff of the portfolio. The following table sets forth our deposits by type of deposit account as of the dates indicated: As of Percent of total (Dollars in thousands) December 31, June 30, Change December 31, June 30, 2021 2021 $ % 2021 2021 Core deposits:      Noninterest-bearing accounts $ 677,159  $ 636,414  $ 40,745  6.4  % 22.6  % 21.5  %      NOW accounts 644,343  644,958  (615) (0.1) 21.5  21.8       Money market accounts 1,010,901  975,001  35,900  3.7  33.7  33.0       Savings accounts 224,474  226,391  (1,917) (0.8) 7.5  7.7  Core deposits 2,556,877  2,482,764  74,113  3.0  85.3  84.0  Certificates of deposit 441,814  472,777  (30,963) (6.5) 14.7  16.0  Total $ 2,998,691  $ 2,955,541  $ 43,150  1.5  % 100.0  % 100.0  % Borrowings.   Borrowings decreased $67.0 million, or 58.3%, to $48.0 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $115.0 million at June 30, 2021 as excess liquidity was used to pay down borrowings. Other liabilities.   Other liabilities decreased $3.3 million, or 5.7%, to $54.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $57.7 million at June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily a result of a $1.7 million, or 48.3%, reduction in accrued profit sharing expenses and a $902,000, or 99.1% decrease in commercial loan suspense. Average Balances, Interest and Average Yield/Cost Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. Interest rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a "volume change". It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a "rate change". The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. 38 The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income and fees on average interest-earning assets and interest expense and interest-bearing liabilities: For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Outstanding Interest Earned/ Paid Yield/ Rate Average Balance Outstanding Interest Earned/ Paid Yield/ Rate Assets: Interest-earning assets: Loans receivable (1)(2) $ 2,819,262  $ 27,236  3.83  % $ 2,826,133  $ 28,648  4.02  % Commercial paper and deposits in other banks 313,882  468  0.59  417,401  614  0.58  Debt securities available for sale 121,987  411  1.34  133,856  504  1.50  Other interest-earning assets (3) 22,327  680  12.09  39,290  696  7.03  Total interest-earning assets 3,277,458  28,795  3.49  3,416,680  30,462  3.54  Other assets 259,591  257,572  Total assets $ 3,537,049  $ 3,674,252  Liabilities and equity: Interest-bearing deposits: Interest-bearing checking accounts $ 635,268  $ 331  0.21  % $ 584,530  $ 353  0.24  % Money market accounts 998,297  349  0.14  848,760  414  0.19  Savings accounts 222,464  40  0.07  206,205  38  0.07  Certificate accounts 443,546  585  0.52  576,078  1,542  1.06  Total interest-bearing deposits 2,299,575  1,305  0.23  2,215,573  2,347  0.42  Borrowings 57,248  15  0.11  475,000  1,688  1.41    Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,356,823  1,320  0.22  2,690,573  4,035  0.59  Noninterest-bearing deposits 736,271  523,488  Other liabilities 44,974  57,813  Total liabilities 3,138,068  3,271,874  Stockholders' equity 398,981  402,378  Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 3,537,049  $ 3,674,252  Net earning assets $ 920,635    $ 726,107  Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 139.06  % 126.99  % Tax-equivalent: Net interest income $ 27,475  $ 26,427  Interest rate spread 3.27  % 2.95  % Net interest margin (4) 3.33  % 3.07  % Non-tax-equivalent: Net interest income $ 27,168  $ 26,122  Interest rate spread 3.23  % 2.91  % Net interest margin (4) 3.29  % 3.03  % _________________________________________________________________ (1) The average loans receivable balances include loans held for sale and nonaccruing loans.

Interest income used in the average interest earned and yield calculation includes the tax equivalent adjustment of $617 and $615 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, calculated based on a combined federal and state income tax rate of 24%. 41 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 General.   During the three months ended December 31, 2021, net income increased $1.6 million, or 17.1% to $11.1 million compared to $9.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.68 compared to $0.57 for the same period in fiscal 2021. Second quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings were positively impacted by a $2.5 million net benefit for credit losses, a $1.0 million increase in net interest income driven by lower borrowing costs, and a $0.8 million increase in noninterest income. Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $1.1 million, or 4.0%, to $27.2 million for the quarter ended   December 31, 2021, compared to $26.1 million for the comparative quarter in fiscal 2021. Interest and dividend income decreased by $1.7 million, or 5.5%, primarily driven by lower average balances on interest-bearing assets combined with lower loan yields. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.7 million, or 67.3%, decrease in interest expense.  Average interest-earning assets decreased $139.2 million, or 4.1%, to $3.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The main drivers of the change were decreases of $103.5 million, or 24.8%, in the average balance of commercial paper and deposits in other banks and $11.9 million, or 8.9%, in debt securities available for sale as the Company continues to use excess liquidity to reduce borrowings, which declined by $417.8 million, or 88.0%, when compared to the prior period. Net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 increased to 3.33% from 3.07% for the same period a year ago as all higher rate long-term borrowings were repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. Total interest and dividend income decreased $1.7 million, or 5.5%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same quarter last year, which was primarily a result of a $1.4 million, or 5.0%, decrease in loan interest income, and a $146,000, or 23.8%, decrease in interest income from commercial paper and deposits in other banks. The lower interest income in each category was mainly driven by the overall decrease in average balances as discussed above, in addition to declines in the average yields on loans of 19 basis points, from 4.02% to 3.83%, and debt securities available for sale of 16 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.34%. Loan interest income for the quarter included the amortization of $286,000 of PPP loan origination fees, a decline of $202,000 when compared to the $488,000 recognized in the prior year period. The overall average yield on interest-earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 3.49% for the current quarter compared to 3.54% in the same quarter last year primarily due to the change in mix of interest-earning assets, as excess liquidity was used to repay long-term borrowings and reduce short-term interest-earning assets with lower yields. Total interest expense decreased $2.7 million, or 67.3%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a $1.7 million, or 99.1%, decrease in interest expense on borrowings as discussed above and a $1.0 million, or 44.4%, decrease in interest expense on deposits. The average balance of total deposits increased by $296.8 million, or 10.8%, with noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits increasing $212.8 million and $84.0 million, respectively.  The increase in interest-bearing deposits was driven by a $149.5 million, or 17.6% increase in money market accounts, partially offset by a $132.5 million, or 23.0%, decrease in certificates of deposit. As stated above, average borrowings for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 decreased $417.8 million, or 88.0%, along with a 130 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings compared to the same period last year. The increase in average deposits (interest and noninterest-bearing) was due to successful deposit gathering campaigns and the effect of government stimulus. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings was primarily driven by the early retirement of long-term borrowings reducing the average balance and partially driven by a shift to short-term borrowings at lower rates.   The overall average cost of funds decreased 37 basis points to 0.22% for the current quarter compared to 0.59% in the same quarter last year. Provision (Benefit) for Credit Losses.   During the three months ended December 31, 2021, there was a $2.5 million net benefit for credit losses compared to a $3.0 million net benefit for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2021. Net loan charge-offs totaled $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared to net recoveries of $62,000 for the same period last year. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 compared to recoveries of 0.01% for the corresponding quarter last year. See "Comparison of Financial Condition - Asset Quality" for additional details. Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income increased $836,000, or 8.9%, to $10.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 from $9.3 million for the same period in the previous year. This change was primarily due to a $369,000, or 27.3%, increase in operating lease income, a $236,000, or 41.5%, increase in loan income and fees, and a $197,000, or 5.3%, increase in gain on sale of loans. The increase in operating lease income was driven by increases in loan originations and higher outstanding lease balances during the period. The increase in loan income and fees was largely a result of transitioning SBA loan servicing processes in-house, which began July 1, 2021. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, $86.9 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale were sold with gains of $2.2 million compared to $108.9 million sold and gains of $2.8 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $12.6 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $1.3 million in the current quarter compared to $9.3 million sold and gains of $778,000 for the same period last year. The Company sold $24.8 million of home equity lines of credit (HELOC) during the quarter for a gain of $159,000 compared to $23.2 million sold and gains of $158,000 in the corresponding period last year. Lastly, $11.5 million of indirect auto finance loans were sold in the current quarter out of the held for investment portfolio for a gain of $205,000. No such sales occurred in the same period in the prior year. Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense decreased $534,000, or 2.0%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period last year, which was primarily a result of a decrease of $828,000, or 5.3%, in salaries and benefits expense due to branch closures and lower mortgage banking incentive pay in the period, partially offset by an increase of $505,000, or 154.4%, in marketing and advertising expense driven by reduced media advertising in the prior period as a result of the pandemic. 42 Income Taxes.   Our income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021 increased $269,000, or 10.4%, to $2.9 million from $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of higher taxable income. The effective tax rates for the quarters ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 20.5% and 21.5%, respectively.  Comparison of Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 General.   During the six months ended December 31, 2021, net income increased by $6.4 million, or 42.0%, to $21.6 million from $15.2 million for the six months ended  December 31, 2020, while o ur diluted earnings per share increased to $1.33 for the  six  months ended  December 31, 2021  compared to $0.92 in the same period in fiscal 2021. Year-to-date  earnings were positively impacted by a $4.0 million net benefit in the provision for credit losses and a $6.1 million, or 67.5%, decrease in interest expense. Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased by $3.2 million, or 6.3%, to $54.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period last year. Interest and dividend income decreased by $2.8 million, or 4.6%, primarily driven by lower average balances on interest-bearing assets combined with lower loan yields. Average interest-earning assets decreased $163.4 million, or 4.8%, to $3.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The biggest reason for the change was a decrease of $125.0 million, or 29.7%, in commercial paper and deposits in other banks, as the Company used excess liquidity to reduce borrowings, where the average balance declined from $475.0 million to $56.4 million. Net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the six months ended December 31, 2021 increased to 3.37% from 3.02% for the same period a year ago as all higher rate long-term borrowings were repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. Total interest and dividend income decreased $2.8 million, or 4.6%, for the six months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period last year, which was primarily a result of a $2.1 million, or 3.7%, decrease in loan interest income and a $696,000, or 46.6%, decrease in interest income from commercial paper and deposits in other banks. The lower interest income in each category was mainly driven by the decrease in average balances as discussed above. In addition, average loan yields decreased 10 basis points to 3.90% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 from 4.00% in the corresponding quarter last year, average yields on debt securities available for sale decreased 28 basis points to 1.43% from 1.71%, and average yields on commercial paper and deposits in other banks decreased 16 basis points to 0.54% from 0.70%. Loan interest income for the six months included the amortization of $710,000 of PPP loan origination fees, a decline of $32,000 when compared to the $742,000 recognized in the prior year period. Despite the decrease in yield on loans and other assets discussed above, the overall average yield on interest-earning assets increased one basis point to 3.55% for the six months compared to 3.54% in the same period last year primarily due to the use of low yielding excess liquidity to repay long-term borrowings. Total interest expense decreased $6.1 million, or 67.5%, for the six months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a $3.3 million, or 98.8%, decrease in interest expense on borrowings as discussed above and a $2.7 million, or 48.6%, decrease in interest expense on deposits. The average balance of total deposits increased by $272.2 million, or 9.9%, with noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits increasing $215.4 million and $56.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest-bearing deposits was driven by a $62.9 million, or 11.0%, increase in interest-bearing checking accounts and a $156.5 million, or 18.7%, increase in money market accounts, partially offset by a $182.2 million, or 28.8%, decrease in certificates of deposit. The increase in average deposits (interest and noninterest-bearing) was due to successful deposit gathering campaigns and the effect of government stimulus. As stated above, average borrowings for the six months ended December 31, 2021 decreased $418.6 million, or 88.1%, along with a 126 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings compared to the same period last year. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings was primarily driven by the early retirement of long-term borrowings reducing the average balance and partially driven by a shift to short-term borrowings at lower rates. The overall average cost of funds decreased 40 basis points to 0.25% for the six months compared to 0.65% in the same period last year. Provision (Benefit) for Loan Losses.   Duri ng the six months ended December 31, 2021 there was a $4.0 million net benefit for credit losses compared to a $2.1 million net benefit for credit losses for the corresponding period of fiscal 2021.  Net loan charge-offs totaled $760,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, compared to net loan charge-offs of $637,000 for the same period last year. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.05% for the six months ended   December 31, 2021 compared to 0.04% for the prior year period.  See "Comparison of Financial Condition - Asset Quality" for additional details. Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased $2.5 million, or 14.2%, to $20.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 from $18.0 million for the same period in the previous year. This change was due to a $910,000, or 12.9%, increase in the gain on sale of loans, a $741,000, or 71.0%, increase in loan income and fees, a $583,000, or 21.8%, increase in operating lease income, and a $372,000, or 8.2%, increase in service charges and fees on deposit accounts. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, $150.7 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale were sold with gains of $4.3 million compared to $190.7 million sold and gains of $5.0 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $27.0 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $3.1 million in the six months compared to $24.5 million sold and gains of $1.8 million for the same period last year. The Company sold $72.2 million of HELOCs during the six months ended December 31, 2021 for a gain of $426,000 compared to $42.1 million sold and gains of $258,000 in the corresponding period last year. Lastly, $11.5 million of indirect auto finance loans were sold out of the held for investment portfolio during the current period for a gain of $205,000. No such sales occurred in the same period in the prior year. The $741,000, or 71.0%, increase in loan income and fees was primarily a result of $536,000 in additional loan servicing fees as a result of bringing the Company's SBA loan servicing process in-house, which began July 1, 2021, and $279,000 in additional prepayment fee income from our equipment finance line of business. The increase in operating lease income was primarily driven by increases in loan originations and higher outstanding lease balances during the period. Lastly, the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was the result of a $290,000 increase in interchange income driven by higher debit card usage. 43 Noninterest Expense.    Noninterest expense decreased $518,000, or 1.0%, for the six months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period last year, which was primarily a result of a decrease of $755,000, or 2.4%, in salaries and benefits expense due to branch closures and lower incentive pay in the period and a reduction of core deposit amortization expense of $282,000, or 64.1%, partially offset by an increase of $885,000, or 135.7%, in marketing and advertising expense driven by reduced media advertising in the prior year period as a result of the pandemic.  Income Taxes.    For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company's income tax expense increased $1.8 million, or 44.6%, to $5.8 million from $4.0 million as a result of higher taxable income. The effective tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 21.3% and 21.0%, respectively. Liquidity Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments, commercial paper, and the securities portfolio. In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $285.1 million with the FHLB of Atlanta, a $59.4 million line of credit with the FRB and a line of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $100.0 million. At December 31, 2021, we had $30.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding, $18.0 million in FRB borrowings outstanding, and nothing outstanding under our other lines of credit. Additionally, we classify our securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our securities portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. We have historically sold longer term fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also may utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2021 brokered deposits totaled $2.3 million, or 0.1%, of total deposits, compared to $4.3 million, or 0.2%, of total deposits, at  June 30, 2021 . Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits, federal funds, and commercial paper. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including MBS. HomeTrust Bancshares on a stand-alone level is a separate legal entity from the Bank and we must provide for our own liquidity and pay our own operating expenses. We have the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. At December 31, 2021, HomeTrust Bancshares on a stand-alone basis had liquid assets of $4.4 million. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At December 31, 2021, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to $279.9 million and $539.8 million, respectively, as compared to $401.1 million and $530.5 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2021. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2021, totaled $381.3 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe a majority of our maturing deposits will continue to remain with us. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 31.7%, to $34.8 million as of December 31, 2021 from $51.0 million as of  June 30, 2021 as excess liquidity was used to pay down borrowings. Off-Balance Sheet Activities In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 44 A summary of our off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2021, is as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Undisbursed portion of construction loans $ 201,032  Commitments to make loans 78,875  Unused lines of credit 539,778  Standby letters of credit 9,496  Total loan commitments $ 829,181  Capital Resources At December 31, 2021, stockholders' equity totaled $401.7 million.

At December 31, 2021, the conservation buffer was 3.80% and 3.45%   for HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank, respectively. Impact of Inflation The effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions. While management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets, it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact. Management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the CPI coincides with changes in interest rates. The price of one or more of the components of the CPI may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall CPI without having a corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us. In years of high inflation and high interest rates, intermediate and long-term interest rates tend to increase, thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities, mortgage loans and other long-term fixed rate loans. In addition, higher short-term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds. In other years, the opposite may occur. Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in our 2021 Form 10-K. 46 Item 4.        Controls and Procedures An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")) as of December 31, 2021, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer   and several other members of the Company's senior management.   The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of December 31, 2021, were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

            OF March 31, 2022 
             (UNAUDITED) 
               
             NOTE
            1 - ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
               
             Exceed World, Inc. (the “Company”), was
            incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014. 
               
             On September 26, 2018, e-Learning Laboratory Co.,
            Ltd. (“e-Learning”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Force International Holdings Limited, which was incorporated in Hong
            Kong with limited liability (“Force Holdings”), entered into a share purchase agreement with Force Internationale Limited
            (“Force Internationale”), the holding company of Force Holdings, in which e-Learning agreed to sell and Force Internationale
            agreed to purchase 74.5% equity interest of the Company at a consideration of $26,000. 
               
             On September 26, 2018, the same date, Force Internationale
            entered into a share purchase agreement with the Company, in which Force Internationale agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase
            100% equity interest of Force Holdings. In consideration of the agreement, the Company issued 12,700,000 common stock at US$1 each to
            Force Internationale. The results of these transactions are that Force Internationale is an 84.4% owner of the Company and the Company
            is a 100% owner of Force Holdings. 
               
             On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a share
            contribution agreement with Force Internationale. Under this agreement, the Company transferred 100% of the equity interest of School
            TV Co., Ltd. ("School TV"), to Force Internationale without consideration. This agreement was approved by the board of directors
            of the Company, Force Internationale and School TV. Upon the completion of the disposal, School TV was deconsolidated from the Company's
            consolidated financial statements. 
               
             As of March 31, 2022, the Company operates through
            our wholly owned subsidiaries, which are engaged in provision of the educational services through an internet platform called “Force
            Club”. 
               
             The Company has elected September 30th as its fiscal
            year end. 
               
             The accompanying unaudited financial statements have
            been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Results
            for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When
            used in these notes, the terms "Company", "we", "us" or "our" mean the Company. Certain information
            and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
            the United States of America has been omitted from these statements pursuant to such accounting principles and, accordingly, they do not
            include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
            financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021, included in our Form 10-K. 
               
             NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
               
             PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION   
               
             The accompanying consolidated financial statements
            include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
               
             RECLASSIFICATION   
               
             Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
            to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings and financial position. 
                 
             USE OF ESTIMATES    
               
             The presentation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as the date
            of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses reported in those financial statements. Certain significant
            accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to valuation allowance on deferred
            income tax, write-down in value of inventory, useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets and legal contingencies. The extent to
            which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain
            and subject to change. Due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact brought
            upon by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. Operating results in the future could
            vary from the amounts derived from management's estimates and assumptions. 
               
             RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION 
               
             A related party is generally defined as (i) any person
            that holds 10% or more of the Company’s securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Company’s management, (iii) someone
            that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly
            influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there
            is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. 
               
             Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed
            to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist. Representations
            about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
            to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. 
               
             FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION   
               
             The Company maintains its books and records in its
            local currencies, Japanese YEN (“JPY”), Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”) and the United States Dollars (“US$”),
            which are the functional currencies as being the primary currencies of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.
            Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
            rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
            currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange
            differences are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
               
             The reporting currency of the Company is US$ and the
            accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$. In accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,  Translation of
            Financial Statement , assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, using the
            exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. Shareholders’
            equity is translated at historical exchange rate at the time of transaction. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial
            statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of changes
            in shareholders’ equity. 
               
             Translation of amounts from the local currency  of
            the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates:

             REVENUE RECOGNITION 
               
             The Company operates and manages multilevel marketing
            (“MLM”) in operating its businesses as the Force Club Membership and generates revenues primarily by providing the rights
            to access the Company’s educational content and to recruit new members. 
               
             The Company
            recognizes revenue by applying the following steps in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from contracts with Customers.  The Company
            recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
            we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. 
               
             - Identification of the contract, or contracts, with
            a customer 
             - Identification of the performance obligations in
            the contract 
             - Determination of the transaction price 
             - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance
            obligations in the contract 
             - Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the
            performance obligation 
               
             Force Club Membership fee  
               
             Nature of operation 
               
             Our revenue generated from Force Club Membership arrangements
            accounted for substantially all of our revenues during the six months ended March 31, 2022. Generally, the Company grants Force Club members
            the rights to access the Company’s educational content. There are two tiers of members, namely standard members and premium members. 
               
             The premium members are granted full access to the
            Company’s educational content and the right to recruit prospect customers to become the Company’s members. Each premium member
            needs to purchase a premium pack, containing promotional materials aiding the recruiting process, from the Company. The standard members
            are granted limited access to the Company’s educational content. 
               
             Revenue from the premium pack is recognized net of
            discounts and return allowances at a point in time upon delivery.
            Revenue from the right to access the Company’s educational content is recognized over a period of time ratably over the effective
            period. For sales of premium packs with return conditions, the Company
            reasonably estimate the possibility of return based on historical experience. There were no liabilities for return allowances nor assets
            from the right to recover products from the associated return allowances recorded as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, as all
            sales of premium packs during the periods then ended have reached the end of the return periods. 
               
             The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews
            results analyzed by customers and the analysis is only presented at the revenue level with no allocation of direct or indirect costs.
            The Company determines that it has only one operating segment. Consequently, the Company does not disaggregate revenue recognized from
            contracts with customers. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue was generated in Japan. 
               
             Contract asset and liability 
               
             Deferred income is recorded when consideration is
            received from a member prior to the goods were delivered or the access was granted. As of March 31, 2022, and September 30, 2021, the Company's
            deferred income was  $ 1,718,611  and  $ 1,515,284  respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized  $ 1,515,284 
            of deferred income in the opening balance. 
               
             The Company does not have any contract asset. 
                
             OPERATING
            LEASES 
               
             The Company recognizes its leases in accordance with
            ASC 842 - Leases. Under ASC 842, lessees are required to recognize all qualified operating leases at the commencement date including a
            lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and
            a right-of-use (ROU) asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset
            for the lease term. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using the Company’s
            incremental borrowing rate, on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it
            is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease
            liability plus any initial direct costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives. 
               
             The Company elected the practical expedient not to
            separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of underlying assets and the short-term lease exemption for contracts with
            lease terms of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes lease expenses for such leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
            In addition, the Company elected the land easement transition practical expedient and did not reassess whether an existing or expired
            land easement is a lease or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a lease.

             NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
               
             FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
            Disclosures , ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
            in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that
            prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies into three levels: 
               
             Level 1:   Quoted prices in active markets for
            identical assets or liabilities.       
               
             Level 2:   Significant other inputs that are
            directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.     
               
             Level 3:   Significant unobservable inputs which
            are supported by little or no market activity. 
               
             In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair
            Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which modifies the disclosure requirements
            for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 effective October 1,
            2020 and determined that the adoption had no material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
                
             The Company considers the carrying amount of its financial
            assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, income tax recoverable, prepaid expenses,
            other current assets, accounts payable, income tax payable, contingency liabilities, deferred income, accrued expenses and other payables,
            other current liabilities and current portion of operating and finance lease obligations approximate the fair value of the respective
            assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021 owing to their short-term or present value nature or present value of
            the assets and liabilities. 
               
             The following table presents information about the
            Company’s  assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021 and indicates the

             NOTE
            9 - CONTINGENCIES 
               
             The Company is subject
            to various claims and l egal proceedings in the course of conducting the business related to Force Club Membership and, from time
            to time, the Company may become involved in additional claims and lawsuits incidental to the businesses. The Company’s legal counsel
            and management routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments and outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses;
            to the extent losses are reasonably estimable. Accruals are recorded for these matters to the extent that management concludes a loss
            is probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonable estimable. 
               
             In the opinion of management, appropriate and adequate accruals for legal matters
            have been made, and management believes that the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued is remote. Nevertheless, the
            Company cannot predict the impact of future developments affecting our pending or future claims and lawsuits. The Company expenses legal
            costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are adjusted as required as better information becomes available to the Company.
            The factors the Company considers when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of the
            Company’s legal counsel; (ii) the Company’s previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend
            to respond to the complaints.  
               
             During the six months ended March 31, 2022,
            the Company has settled sixteen cases related to the cancellation of contracts in amount of approximately JPY35.4 million (approximately $289,000). As of filing date, the Company had nine pending legal cases, claiming a damage
            of approximately JPY205.3 million (approximately $1.7
            million) under the same nature, and the Company’s legal counsel estimated a probable settlement for these cases with total
            settlement amount of approximately JPY82.1 million (approximately $671,000).
            The Company accrued a total liability of JPY82.1 million (approximately $671,000)
            as of March 31, 2022 for pending legal cases as of filing date.

             Forward-Looking Statements 
               
             Certain statements, other than purely historical information,
            including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions
            upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
            Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
            forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,”
            “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,”
            “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar
            expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained
            in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor
            provisions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which
            may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect
            of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future
            prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability
            of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered
            in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

             Company Overview 
               
             Corporate History 
               
             The Company was originally incorporated with the name
            Brilliant Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with,
            an operating business. On January 12, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of
            the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“e-Learning”).
            Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to e-Learning, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represents all of our issued
            and outstanding shares. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, e-Learning gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding
            shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder of the Company. 
               
             On January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name
            to Exceed World, Inc. and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment. On January 12, 2016, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio
            resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. Also, on January 12,
            2016, Mr. Tomoo Yoshida was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 
               
             On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock
            Purchase Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
            Pursuant to this Agreement, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E&F Co., Ltd., a Japan
            corporation (“E&F”), which represents all of its issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $4,835 (JPY 500,000).
            Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the
            issued and outstanding shares of E&F’s common stock and E&F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World. On August
            4, 2016, the E&F changed its name to School TV Co., Ltd (“School TV”) and filed with the Legal Affairs Bureau in Osaka,
            Japan. 
               
             On April 1, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase
            agreements with 7 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 140,000 shares of common stock in total to these
            individuals and received $270 as aggregate consideration. Each paid JPY0.215 per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share
            by each was the equivalent of about $0.002. This sale of shares was exempt from registration in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities
            Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") because the above sales of the stock were made to non-U.S. persons as defined under
            Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S, pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United
            States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. 
               
             On August 1, 2016, the Company changed its fiscal
            year end from November 30 to September 30. 
               
             On August 9, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase
            agreements with 33 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 3,300 shares of common stock in total to these
            individuals and received $330 as aggregate consideration. Each paid JPY10 per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share
            by each shareholder was the equivalent to about $0.1. These shares were sold pursuant to the Company’s effective S-1 Registration
            Statement deemed effective on July 20, 2016 at 4pm EST. 
               
             On October 28, 2016, the Company, with the approval
            of its board of directors and its majority shareholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting, authorized the cancellation of shares
            owned by e-Learning. e-Learning consented to the cancellation of shares. The total number of shares cancelled was 19,000,000 shares which
            was comprised of 16,500,000 restricted common shares and 2,500,000 free trading shares. 
               
             On October 28, 2016, every one (1) share of common
            stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding was automatically reclassified and changed into twenty (20) shares
            fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company, par value $.0001 per share. (“20-for-1 Forward Stock Split”)
            No fractional shares were issued. The authorized number of shares, and par value per share, of common stock are not affected by the 20-for-1
            Forward Stock Split. 
               
             During July 2017 and August 2017, e-Learning entered
            into stock purchase agreements with 24 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 2,240,000 shares of its common
            stock in total to these individuals and received $38,263 as aggregate consideration. 
               
             On September 26, 2018, Force Internationale Limited,
            a Cayman Island limited company (“Force Internationale”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
            e-Learning and 74.5% owner of the Company. Under this Share Purchase Agreement, e-Learning transferred its 74.5% interest in the Company
            to Force Internationale. As consideration for this transfer, Force Internationale paid $26,000.00 to e-Learning. Immediately subsequent,
            the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Force Internationale, to acquire 100% of Force Holdings and 100% direct owner
            of e-Learning. In consideration of this agreement, the Company issued 12,700,000 common shares to Force Internationale. The result of
            these transaction is that Force Internationale is a 84.4% owner of the Company, the Company is a 100% owner of Force Holdings, and Force
            Holdings is a 100% owner of e-Learning. Prior to the Share Purchase Agreements, Force Internationale was an indirect owner of 74.5% of
            the Company and subsequent to the Share Purchase Agreements, Force Internationale is a direct owner of 84.4% of the Company. The Share
            Purchase Agreements were approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, Force Internationale, Force Holdings, and e-Learning. 
               
             On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a share
            contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Force Internationale. Under this Agreement, the Company transferred
            100% of the equity interest of School TV Co., Ltd. ("School TV"), to Force Internationale without consideration. This Contribution
            Agreement was approved by the board of directors of the Company, Force Internationale and School TV. Upon the completion of the disposal,
            School TV was deconsolidated from the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
               
             Business Information 
               
             As of March 31, 2022, we operate through our wholly-owned
            subsidiaries, which are engaged in the provision of the educational services through an internet platform called “Force Club”. 
               
             Our principal executive offices are located at 1-1-36, 1-23-38-6F, Esakacho,
            Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063, Japan. Our phone number is +81-6-6339-4177. 
               
             Liquidity and Capital Resources   
               
             As of March 31, 2022, and September 30, 2021, we had
            cash  in the amount of $20,303,775 and $23,056,242, respectively. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund
            our operations without the need for additional funding. 
               
             Revenues 
               
             We recorded revenue of $6,525,769 for the three months
            ended March 31, 2022 as opposed to $4,243,964 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We recorded revenue of 11,568,356 for the six
            months ended March 31, 2022 as opposed to $15,155,701 for the six months ended March 31, 2021. The increase/decrease in revenue, in our
            opinion, is attributed to increase/decrease in recruitment activities of premium Force Club members.

            to increase in revenues. We recorded net income of $48,554 for the six months ended March 31, 2022 as opposed to net income of $1,737,840
            for the six months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in net income is attributed to decrease in revenues. 
               
             Cash flow 
               
             For the six months ended March 31, 2022 we had negative
            cash flows from operations in the amount of $1,260,035. For the six months ended March 31, 2021, we had cash flows from operations in
            the amount of $1,195,844. The decrease in operating cash flow, in our opinion, is mainly attributed to the decrease in net income and
            change in fair value of marketable securities, and increase in settlement of account payable and income tax payable. 
               
             Working capital 
               
             As of March 31 2022, and September 30, 2021, we had
            working capital of $14,215,855 and $15,695,158, respectively. 
               
             Advertising 
               
             Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included
            in selling and distributions expenses. Advertising expenses were $208,059 and $85,379 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
            respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising expenses were $551,629 and $176,903, respectively. 
               
             Advertising expenses were comprised of, but not limited
            to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards, and public relations
            activities. 
               
             Future Plans 
               
             Over the course of the next twelve months, the Company
            continues to focus on expanding its sales network in order to strengthen its business activities. Though the sales were relatively slow
            in the first half year of the financial year ending September 30, 2022, the Company expects that it will be recovered in the second half
            year. We also plan to provide some benefits and incentives to the Premium Members as value-added services, in addition to the normal compensation
            package. 
               
             Impact of COVID-19 
               
             Due to the quasi-emergency measures and the spread
            of Omicron variant, economy recovery in Japan remained moderate during the second quarter of the financial year ending September 30, 2022.
            The quasi-emergency measures was lifted in March, economy activity in Japan is expected to be normalized during the third quarter and
            onwards. However, as there is still high uncertainty of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact
            brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time.

             CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
             
             Management’s Report on Disclosure
            Controls and Procedures 
               
             We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
            are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
            is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
            forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
            financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to
            allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
               
             As of March 31, 2022,
            the end of the fiscal period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer,
            with the participation of our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls
            and procedures. The officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered
            by this report due to material weaknesses identified below.   
               
             The matters involving internal controls and procedures
            that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination
            of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors,
            inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report
            related party transactions and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer who
            also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the above annual evaluation. 
               
             Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
               
             Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
            limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
            and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
            over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
            resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
            override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a
            timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into
            the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
            only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
            to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
            compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
               
             Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
               
             There have been no changes in our internal controls
            over financial reporting that have occurred for the three months ended March 31, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely to
            materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

             ITEM 1 
             LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
             
             During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company
            has settled sixteen cases related to the cancellation of contracts in amount of approximately JPY35.4 million (approximately $289,000).
            As of filing date, the Company had nine pending legal cases, claiming a damage of approximately JPY205.3 million (approximately $1.7 million)
            under the same nature, and the Company’s legal counsel estimated a probable settlement for these cases with total settlement amount
            of approximately JPY82.1 million (approximately $671,000). The Company accrued a total liability of JPY82.1 million (approximately $671,000)
            as of March 31, 2022 for pending legal cases as of filing date. 
               
             During the past ten (10) years, none of our directors,
            persons nominated to become directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons was involved in any of the legal proceedings listen
            in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K.
