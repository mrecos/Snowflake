v3.1: All-White Minimalist UI Inspired by Snowflake Intelligence

Complete redesign with extreme white space and strategic blue accents.
Inspired by the "Snowflake Intelligence" interface philosophy.

Design Philosophy:
- All-white backgrounds (sidebar, header, content - everything)
- Snowflake Blue used ONLY as text accent (H2 welcome message)
- Extreme white space (80px/120px padding for airy feel)
- Minimalist navigation with subtle 1px borders
- Clean, airy, breathable interface that lets content shine
- Strategic use of color rather than colorful backgrounds

Major Changes:
1. Removed blue header entirely
   - Replaced with fixed-position status indicator (top-right)
   
2. Sidebar redesign (blue → white)
   - Changed from Snowflake Blue background to white
   - Added subtle 1px border (#F0F0F0)
   - Updated text colors to Medium Gray
   - Minimalist navigation with icon hints
   - Logo at top (32px, subtle)
   
3. Welcome section (NEW)
   - Dynamic greeting based on time of day
     * "Good morning" (5 AM - 11:59 AM)
     * "Good afternoon" (12 PM - 4:59 PM)
     * "Good evening" (5 PM - 4:59 AM)
   - H1: Greeting in Arial Bold, 26pt, Black
   - H2: "What insights can I help with?" in Arial Bold, 44pt, Snowflake Blue
   - Shows when no messages, hides when conversation starts
   
4. Message bubbles refined
   - Changed from light gray to ultra-light gray (#FAFAFA)
   - Added subtle colored left borders (3-4px)
     * User: Mid-Blue (#11567F)
     * Agent: Snowflake Blue (#29B5E8)
   - Increased internal padding (24-32px)
   - Max-width 85% for breathing room
   
5. Extreme white space
   - Main content: 80px vertical, 120px horizontal padding
   - Sidebar: 32px vertical, 24px horizontal padding
   - Between messages: 32px
   - Between sections: 40-60px
   
6. Typography refinement
   - Welcome H2 is the PRIMARY blue accent (44pt)
   - All other text: Black or Medium Gray
   - Table headers: Mid-Blue accent (#11567F)
   - Proper hierarchy: 44pt → 26pt → 18pt → 14pt

Color Palette (Strategic):

- Mid-Blue (#11567F) - Table headers, message headers, accents
